statistical correlations between particles play a central role in the study of complex quantum systems. a new study introduces microscopic detection of ultracold molecules and demonstrates the measurement of two-particle correlations.you have full access to this article via your institution.the quantum nature of indistinguishable particles manifests in simple interference experiments. when two possible paths for two particles to arrive at two separate detectors have the same length, the interference of the paths creates a modified joint detection probability. this effect generates bunching in the case of bosons (fig. 1a) and antibunching correlations in the case of fermions. such correlations are called hanbury brown and twiss (hbt) correlations after pioneering work in the 1950s on photon number measurements1, but they have since been observed in other systems including ultracold atomic gases of bosons2,3 and fermions4,5. writing in nature physics, jason rosenberg and colleagues6 report the detection of hbt correlations in gases of ultracold molecules, enabled by the development of a molecular quantum gas microscope.a, first, 23na87rb molecules are prepared in an optical lattice. b, a microwave sweep then breaks the molecules while flipping the spin of the 23na atoms, resulting in unbound 23na (blue) and 87rb (red) atoms. c, in the final step, the 23na atoms are removed by means of a resonant light beam (blue), and the remaining 87rb atoms are imaged through fluorescence induced by laser cooling beams (red). adapted from ref. 6.dilute clouds of neutral atoms at nanokelvin temperatures are now routinely produced in the laboratory through a combination of laser cooling and evaporative cooling. at these temperatures, the particles can show either bosonic or fermionic behaviour depending on the chosen isotope. after cooling, the atoms can then be arranged in various lattice geometries by loading them into a standing wave of laser light — an optical lattice.this kind of control has made ultracold atoms an important system for applications of quantum technology, such as the quantum simulation of solid-state phenomena. a breakthrough development in the field was the realization of quantum gas microscopes, which enabled the detection of the position of individual particles of a many-body quantum state through fluorescence imaging of the atoms held in the optical lattice7,8.a major current research direction is to combine ultracold atoms into molecules, which greatly increases the complexity of the quantum system by additionally introducing rovibrational degrees of freedom. rosenberg et al. have now taken a decisive step by realizing a quantum gas microscope tailored for ultracold molecules. in their experiment, they first created 23na87rb molecules and then used the 87rb atoms as a tag for the positions of the molecules. after fixing the molecules in the optical lattice, the team broke up the molecules via a microwave sweep and removed the 23na atoms with a resonant light pulse (fig. 1b). this procedure allowed them to detect the positions of over 100 molecules in the optical lattice simultaneously.to measure the hbt correlations, the authors released the molecules from the optical lattice and recaptured them after a fixed expansion time. this allowed them to measure site-resolved positions with single-particle detection efficiency. this particle shot noise-limited detection is crucial for high visibility of the intensity interference. the observed mean density distribution was featureless because there was no initial phase coherence between the molecules on different lattice sites that would yield single-particle interference. however, when analysing the density correlations from many individual clouds of molecules, sharp interference peaks appeared at relative particle distances dictated by the lattice spacing of the initial cloud. the authors observed a high interference contrast, which indicates a high degree of indistinguishability of the molecules in the initially prepared cloud.in their experiments, the team cooled clouds of 23na and 87rb and used magnetoassociation to form ‘feshbach molecules’, in which the two atoms are only weakly bound. the next step will be to transfer the molecules into their rovibrational ground state, which has been previously achieved first for 40k87rb (ref. 9) but also for 23na87rb molecules10. these heteronuclear molecules have a large, tunable electric dipole moment in their ground state and form a molecular gas with strong long-range interactions. combining these dipolar interactions with the possibilities offered by the quantum gas microscope developed by rosenberg and collaborators will greatly expand the range of quantum correlations and effects that can be studied in synthetic many-body quantum systems.hanbury brown, r. & twiss, r. q. phil. mag. 45, 663–682 (1954).ads article google scholar
