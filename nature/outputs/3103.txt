analyzing plants science remains a bedrock of efforts to reverse the impact of climate change on african agriculture.credit: andreswd/e+/getty imageslire en francaisclimate change is an increasing threat to food security on the african continent. agriculture is both a major casualty and contributor because of its release of powerful greenhouse gases. for crops to thrive, they need adequate water and sunlight, heat and suitable soil — all in the right balance. but climate change is affecting this balance, especially through its effect on the length of season during which farmers can grow their crops.by 2030, it is estimated that up to 118 million extremely poor people will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat in africa, if adequate response measures are not put in place, according to josefa leonel correia sacko, commissioner for rural economy and agriculture at the african union commission. climate change in africa is expected to place additional burdens on poverty alleviation efforts and decrease gross domestic product by up to 3% by 2050. in a continent that deals with ,more than 100 disease outbreaks and several other emergencies and disruptions every year, there are huge challenges for climate adaptation and resilience action.this phenomenon is not peculiar to africa. but the lack of safety nets and support services for small scale farmers in particular, raises concerns that farms affected by climate change may not be able to survive.there are many examples of extreme weather conditions in recent years. in 2020, extreme rainfall in zambia, largely due to the passage of tropical cyclones over the southern indian ocean towards southern africa inundated nearly 3,000 hectares of cultivated crops in namwala district in the southern province. one of the bridges that connected the district to the rest of the country was damaged by the bursting rivers and overflowing of the kabulamwanda dam. communities of pastoralist farmers were affected as grazing lands were covered in water.in west africa, the niger river had exceptional flooding in 2020, submerging nearly 10,000 hectares of crops, especially in the regions of maradi, tillabéri, dosso, niamey, tahoua and zinder.the global report on food crises of the world food programme reported that the number of people in africa experiencing acute food insecurity and needing humanitarian assistance in 2020 rose by almost 40% from 2019 to nearly 100 million. the wfp said a major contributor to this was reduced crop yield in several african countries as a result of poor rains in some areas, and unusually heavy rains elsewhere. the resultant losses and damages to the agrifood systems across the continent, in addition to damaged rural and market infrastructure, also disrupted the flow of trade.an ipcc special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems, concluded that climate change in africa has increased the frequency and intensity of droughts in some regions, reduced animal growth rates and productivity in pastoral systems, and produced negative effects in food security in drylands.west africa has a high number of people vulnerable to increased desertification and yield decline, and the situation is likely to worsen, with africa projected to be one of the regions with the highest number of people vulnerable to increased desertification, the report states.at the 2021 united nations climate change conference (cop26), a number of approaches were put forward as climate change mitigation measures, one of which was the adoption of conservation agriculture. one of its advocates is murray lark, professor of environmetrics in the school of biosciences, at the university of nottingham, and a member of the future food research beacon.lark says that in conservation agriculture farmers avoid tilling the soil which prevents the disruption of its natural structure. the soil surface is also kept covered with crop residues or other plant material, to reduce surface runoff during heavy rainstorms, to avoid high soil temperatures, and to improve the organic carbon content of the soil, along with its biological activity.in order to reduce pest and disease pressure, the cropping system is also diversified, by rotation or intercropping, where two crops are planted together. for example, a crop like cowpea or soybean, intercropped with maize, will protect the soil surface, provide additional crop residues, promote the nutrient status of the soil through the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by associated bacteria and also provide an additional food source, lark says.but there are downsides to conservation agriculture including reduced production due to minimum tillage, difficulties in maintenance, lack of extension service, lack of expertise and training, lack of proper machinery, competition for the use of crop residues in rainy areas, weed management strategies, disease and pest infestation, and yield reduction.with climate change mitigation measures not expected have fast results in africa, and conservation agriculture requiring more effort to successfully implement, research into improving the ability of crops to withstand the impacts of climate change is a major priority of agricultural research on the continent. efforts are already underway to increase drought and disease resistance.there is ongoing research into how to make cassava, the staple food of nearly 1 billion people worldwide, more resilient. its ability to withstand difficult growing conditions and to be stored underground for long periods makes it an ideal contributor to food security.in a recent statement, the international institute of tropical agriculture (iita) said breeders are concentrating on developing improved varieties of cassava that will be more resistant to weeds, pests and disease.researchers recently mapped the genome of african cassava, using the tme 204 variety resistant to cassava mosaic disease-2 (cmd2). this breakthrough was described as a significant milestone that will help advance the rapid breeding of new cassava varieties with greater accuracy.the study, led by wilhelm gruissem of the department of biology, institute of molecular plant biology, swiss federal institute of technology in zürich described the cassava genome as having a very high quality and accuracy, and the haplotypes of the heterozygous genome have been resolved with high confidence.it is now definitively the gold standard genome for african cassava, he says. the study is also expected to provide insights into the development of cost-effective and efficient strategies for resolving complex genomes in other crops with high resolution, accuracy, and continuity.while cassava is emerging as a top candidate for resilient crop research in africa, the line of research is also extending to cowpeas and other staple crops. a study, led by assefa amelework from the agricultural research council, vegetable and ornamental plants, pretoria, south africa, suggested that the exploration of alternative climate resilient solutions have become a priority.awareness of the prevailing environmental conditions and the available mitigation strategies are imperative, the authors state. furthermore, the use of a promotional hub is vital to introduce various cassava products to researchers, policy makers, producers, and processors to appreciate the economic importance of the crop.they also made a case for the adoption of climate smart agricultural techniques and job creation in rural communities to increase resilience and contribute to more sustainable food systems.to this effect, a holistic and comprehensive research and development strategy, cutting across various disciplines, is necessary to harmonize the relationship between climate challenge and agriculture, they conclude.
