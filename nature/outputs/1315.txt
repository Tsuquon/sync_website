some creatures have what it takes to survive long dry spells. how they do this may be revealed in their genes, reports erika check hayden.you have full access to this article via your institution.[image 5 right]one day in 2003, a biologist collecting specimens stumbled across the nightmare of every scientist who studies ancient asexual organisms: a male[6].robin smith from lake biwa museum in shiga, japan, had gone hunting for darwinulid ostracods — tiny freshwater crustaceans long thought to be asexual. he was searching on a forested island called yakushima, off the coast of southern japan, with a colleague, takahiro kamiya from kanazawa university. while looking for specimens in a stream near the coast, smith spotted an ostracod that seemed unusually small. it wasn't until he got back to his lab and dissected the animal that he saw it wasn't just small — it was a male. it had the telltale hooks on its legs, for instance, that male ostracods use to grab their female partners while mating.researchers were already dubious about the asexual credentials of darwinulids. they had found low heterozygosity between individuals, suggesting that the tiny creatures could be having sex. but finding a male was a catastrophe for those who believed in the organisms' asexuality. david mark welch, who studies asexual rotifers called bdelloids at the marine biology laboratory in woods hole, massachusetts, commiserates: throughout my graduate career we lived in fear of reading some report of male bdelloids.[image 4 right]smith and kamiya's find raised the question of whether darwinulid males had simply been overlooked in the fossil record because they looked a lot like juvenile females. "without this fossil evidence, the hypothesis that this group is ancient and asexual doesn't have that much other support," says smith. he and kamiya have gone back to yakushima numerous times, and have only turned up two more males, among thousands more females. so it's not clear whether the males had any role in the population, or whether they were just random curiosities. nonetheless, the finds raised a caveat about the evidence for asexuality in ostracods — and leaves the bdelloids as perhaps the last thriving asexual animals.*e.c.h.* [journal]nature[/journal] [volume]324[/volume], [pages]300–301[/pages] ([copyright]1986[/copyright]).mark welch, d. b. & meselson, m.
