 in this first episode of nature’s take, we get four of nature’s staff around microphones to get their expert take on preprints. these pre-peer-review open-access articles have spiked in number over recent years and have cemented themselves as an integral part of scientific publishing. but this has not been without its issues.in this discussion, we cover a lot of ground. among other things, we ask whether preprints could help democratize science or contribute to a loss of trust in scientists. we pick apart the relationship between preprints and peer-reviewed journals and tackle some common misconceptions. we ask how preprints have been used by different fields and how the pandemic has changed the game. and as we look to the future, we ask how preprints fit into the discussion around open access and even if they could do away with journals all together.
