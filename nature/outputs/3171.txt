catalytic intramolecular c–h amination via nitrene transfer typically yields n-heterocycles which can be unmasked to amino alcohols and diamines. now, an enantioselective co-catalysed 1,5-c–h amination to form cyclic sulfamidates from alcohols allows for ring opening to deliver diverse β-functionalized chiral amines.now, writing in nature synthesis, zhang and co-workers report a bridged d2-symmetric amidoporphyrin co(ii) catalyst for the asymmetric 1,5-c(sp3)–h amination of sulfonyl azides to form strained cyclic sulfamidates3. nucleophilic ring opening of these cyclic sulfamidates substantially expands the scope of β-functionality that can be installed in the amine products.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.reddy, r. p. & davies, h. m. l. org. lett. 8, 5013–5016 (2006).cas article google scholar zhou, z. et al. chem 6, 2024–2034 (2020).cas article google scholar lang, k., hu, y., lee, w.-c. c. & zhang, x. p. nat. synth. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00107-3 (2022).article google scholar lang, k., torker, s., wojtas, l. & zhang, x. p. j. am. chem. soc. 141, 12388–12396 (2019).cas article google scholar adams, c. s., boralsky, l. a., guzei, i. a. & schomaker, j. m. j. am. chem. soc. 134, 10807–10810 (2012).cas article google scholar bower, j. f., rujirawanich, j. & gallagher, t. org. biomol. chem. 8, 1505–1519 (2010).cas article google scholar cardona, f. & goti, a. nat. chem. 1, 269–275 (2009).cas article google scholar pendem, n. et al. j. am. chem. soc. 135, 4884–4892 (2013).cas article google scholar download referencestwitter: @emilyzerulltwitter: @jenniferschoma4department of chemistry, university of wisconsin, madison, wi, usaemily e. zerull & jennifer m. schomakeryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to jennifer m. schomaker.the authors declare no competing interests.reprints and permissionszerull, e.e., schomaker, j.m. chiral amine synthesis refashioned. nat. synth 1, 506–507 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00110-8download citationpublished: 13 july 2022issue date: july 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00110-8anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
