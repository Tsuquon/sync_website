collateral arteries may act as natural bypasses that reduce hypoperfusion after a coronary blockage. 3d imaging of neonatal and adult mouse hearts, plus human fetal and diseased adult hearts, is now used to computationally predict flow within the heart, and understand the cardioprotective role of collateral arteries in vivo.heart disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide1,2,3. cardiomyocytes, the muscular working cells of the heart, have immense energetic and nutritive demands, which the coronary vasculature normally meets by constantly supplying oxygen, nutrients and hormones to the continuously pumping heart. however, blockage or occlusion of these vessels, as occurs in coronary artery disease, can lead to a heart attack or acute myocardial infarction, resulting in the death of potentially up to one billion myocytes distal to the infarcted region4. unlike other species, myocytes in the adult human heart are considered terminally differentiated, with limited cell cycle activity. thus, the irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction leads to the formation of permanent scars owing to extensive inflammation and compensatory fibrosis, which in turn results in cardiac stiffening and decreased contractility, and this adverse remodeling ultimately leads to heart failure.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.timmis, a. et al. eur. heart j. 43, 716–799 (2022).article google scholar virani, s. s. et al. circulation 143, e254–e743 (2021).article google scholar zhao, d. jacc asia 1, 1–13 (2021).article google scholar lazar, e. et al. eur. heart j. 38, 2333–2342 (2017).article google scholar garbern, j. c. et al. dev. cell 57, 424–439 (2022).cas article google scholar tian, x. et al. j. mol. cell. cardiol. 167, 67–82 (2022).cas article google scholar cortis, b. s. et al. cardiologia 43, 77–81 (1998).cas pubmed google scholar wustmann, k. et al. circulation 107, 2213–2220 (2003).article google scholar seiler, c. eur. j. clin. invest. 40, 465–476 (2010).article google scholar zhang, h. et al. j. mol. cell. cardiol. 87, 4–16 (2015).cas article google scholar he, l. et al. cardiovasc. res. 109, 419–430 (2016).cas article google scholar das, s. et al. cell 176, 1128–1142 (2019).cas article google scholar anbazhakan, s. et al. nat. cardiovas. res. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-022-00114-9 (2022).article google scholar renier, n. et al. cell 159, 896–910 (2014).cas article google scholar kirst, c. et al. cell 180, 780–795 (2020).cas article google scholar olarte, o. e., andilla, j., gualda, e. j. & loza-alvarez, p. adv. opt. photonics 10, 111–179 (2018).article google scholar download referencesdepartment of electrical and computer engineering, university of houston, houston, tx, usadavid mayerichdepartment of integrative physiology, baylor college of medicine, houston, tx, usajoshua d. wythecardiovascular research institute, baylor college of medicine, houston, tx, usajoshua d. wythecenter for organ renewal and repair, baylor college of medicine, houston, tx, usajoshua d. wytheyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to joshua d. wythe.d.m. is a founder and stakeholder of swift front.reprints and permissionsmayerich, d., wythe, j.d. computational insights on coronary artery function. nat cardiovasc res 1, 691–693 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-022-00115-8download citationpublished: 12 august 2022issue date: august 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-022-00115-8anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
