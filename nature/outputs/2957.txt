the replacement of damaged cardiomyocytes by extracellular matrix-producing fibroblasts underpins adverse remodeling in the failing heart. new research finds that mhc class ii-dependent fibroblast–cd4+ t cell interactions in the myocardium lead to fibroblast activation and exacerbate fibrotic remodeling of the myocardium.the adaptive arm of the immune system — that is, antibody-generating b cells, target cell-killing cd8+ t cells and cytokine-secreting cd4+ t cells — has evolved to provide highly specific measures for the protection against pathogen infections and the control of commensal microorganisms that have colonized mammalian body surfaces and organs. to achieve these tasks, t and b cells need to balance reactivity against infectious non-self (foreign) and non-infectious self components1. the grand theories behind the discrimination of immunological self and non-self correctly predicted that specific lymphocytes are clonally selected by antigens as ‘signal 1’2 and that a second signal (signal 2) is required for clonal lymphocyte expansion and to activate effector functions3. consequently, the encountering of signal 1 (antigen) in the absence of signal 2 results in the inactivation of specific lymphocytes clones3, mainly through the switch to an ‘anergic’ state that comprises loss of proliferative capacity and effector function4. thus, immune reactivity to both self and non-self antigens is controlled by context-dependent tuning of activation thresholds5. in other words, the nature, extent and context of antigen-presentation to t cells determines the degree and consequences of t cell-mediated inflammation in any tissue.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.janeway, c. a. cold spring harb. symp. quant. biol. 54, 1–13 (1989).cas article google scholar burnet, f. m. aust. j. sci. 20, 67–69 (1957). google scholar bretscher, p. & cohn, m. science 169, 1042–1049 (1970).cas article google scholar schwartz, r. h. science 248, 1349–1356 (1990).cas article google scholar grossman, z. & paul, w. e. semin. immunol. 12, 197–203 (2000).cas article google scholar ngwenyama, n. et al. nat. cardiovasc. res. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-022-00116-7 (2022).article google scholar souders, c. a., borg, t. k., banerjee, i. & baudino, t. a. am. j. pathol. 181, 1226–1235 (2012).article google scholar simons, k. h. et al. nat. rev. cardiol. 16, 325–343 (2019).article google scholar krovi, s. h. & kuchroo, v. k. immunol. rev. 307, 161–190 (2022).cas article google scholar nevers, t. et al. j. exp. med. 214, 3311–3329 (2017).cas article google scholar gomes, j. a. et al. infect. immun. 71, 1185–1193 (2003).cas article google scholar teiger, e. et al. j. clin. invest. 97, 2891–2897 (1996).cas article google scholar lv, h. et al. j. clin. invest. 121, 1561–1573 (2011).cas article google scholar gil-cruz, c. et al. science 366, 881–886 (2019).cas article google scholar rieckmann, m. et al. j. clin. invest. 130, 4922–4936 (2019).article google scholar download referenceswe thank n. pikor for critical reading of the manuscript.institute of immunobiology, kantonsspital st gallen, st gallen, switzerlandchristian perez-shibayama, cristina gil-cruz & burkhard ludewigdepartment of cardiology, university heart center, university hospital zurich, zurich, switzerlandburkhard ludewigyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to burkhard ludewig.c.g.c., c.p.s. and b.l. are co-founders and shareholders of stromal therapeutics.reprints and permissionsperez-shibayama, c., gil-cruz, c. & ludewig, b. fibroblasts tune myocardial inflammation and remodeling. nat cardiovasc res 1, 694–695 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-022-00119-4download citationpublished: 12 august 2022issue date: august 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-022-00119-4anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
