more than ever, nations are powering themselves from abundant supplies of fossil fuels. boxed-text even though countries are burning unprecedented amounts of oil and gas, the estimates of how much is left continue to grow, thanks to high prices and new technologies that have enabled companies to find and extract new resources. a decade ago, it was the tar sands of canada and venezuela. more recently, hydraulic-fracturing technologies have opened up oil and gas resources in the united states. across the globe, proven oil and gas reserves are 60% higher today than they were in 1991. at current consumption rates, those reserves would last for about 60 years — and that could be extended by new discoveries and unconventional deposits. coal reserves have not increased in size, but the supply will last for at least a century at current rates of consumption.renewables such as solar and wind power are growing faster than any other source of energy, but are barely making a dent in fossil-fuel consumption. the scale of the challenge will only grow as the expanding global population requires more energy. this tour of global and regional energy trends makes clear that even with aggressive action to reduce energy consumption and curb emissions, fossil fuels will be around for a very long time.in 2011, the globe consumed the equivalent of 12,275 million tonnes of oil. figures for the top 50 nations show how important fossil fuels remain; they supplied 87% of the world’s energy.use our interactive graphic to explore the figures and compare who used what in 2011.source: bp statistical review of world energy 2012you can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholar legacy of a climate treaty: after kyoto 2012-nov-28  what's at stake in doha climate talks 2012-nov-23  slow progress to cleaner coal 2012-apr-11  oil-sands vote ends in deadlock 2012-feb-24  global change: china at the carbon crossroads 2009-apr-22  nature special: after kyoto  nature special: rio+20  nature special: climate showdown in durban  nature special: fossil fuels  world energy outlook 2012  bp statistical review of world energy  international energy agency 2010 special report: how to make a modern energy access universal reprints and permissionstollefson, j., monastersky, r. the global energy challenge: awash with carbon. nature 491, 654–655 (2012). https://doi.org/10.1038/491654adownload citationpublished: 28 november 2012issue date: 29 november 2012doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/491654aanyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative bioenergy research (2017)nature communications (2014)
