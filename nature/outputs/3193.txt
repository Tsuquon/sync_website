genetic variation linked to lower levels of soluble st2, a decoy cytokine receptor for il-33, may protect against alzheimer’s disease in women carrying the apoeε4 allele by increasing microglial plaque removal. this discovery advances our understanding of the immune system’s role in alzheimer’s disease and underscores the importance of sex-specific disease processes.you have full access to

neurologic health. microglia — the brain’s resident immune cells — must exert an optimal balance between maintaining cellular homeostasis and reactive activation in the context of damage (staying within the so-called goldilocks zone) to stave off neurodegenerative pathology such as that seen in alzheimer’s disease (ad). among the many jobs that microglia perform, perhaps the most consequential is the removal of pathogenic molecules from the brain, including amyloid-β (aβ) plaques, which are a key feature of ad. factors that influence microglia activation, particularly microglia interactions with aβ plaques, appear to have a considerable bearing on ad risk and rate of progression1,2,3. in this issue of nature aging, jiang and colleagues demonstrate that soluble st2 (sst2), a secreted isoform of the membrane-bound interleukin-33 (il-33) receptor (st2l), influences ad pathogenesis by dampening microglia activation and inhibiting microglial clearance of aβ, particularly among women who are apoeε4 positive4.the authors had good reasons to suspect that sst2, a secreted decoy receptor for il-33, may play a role in ad. il-33 cytokine signaling through the st2l receptor has been shown to enhance microglial clearance of aβ, as well as reversing synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in an ad mouse model5. by contrast, sst2 can function as a secreted decoy receptor for il-33 that can inhibit il-33–st2l-mediated signalling6. this capacity to block the protective effects of il-33, along with previously published data suggesting that sst2 serum levels are increased in mild cognitive impairment, suggested to jiang and colleagues that increasing levels of sst2 may increase ad risk by compromising the ability of microglia to remove cortical aβ5.to test their hypothesis, the authors first measured sst2 protein concentrations in plasma from a group of older chinese adults and found that individuals with dementia due to ad tended to have higher sst2 levels. in support of this finding, higher circulating levels of sst2 were associated with smaller brain volumes, as well as elevated levels of biomarkers for ad pathology (tau phosphorylated on thr181) and neurodegeneration (neurofilament light chain). although levels of sst2 were higher among men, the authors found a much stronger association between sst2 and ad among women, particularly those who carried an ε4 allele of the major ad risk gene apoe. to understand the role of sst2 in the central nervous system, the authors used the uk brain banks network to measure sst2 in cerebrospinal fluid (csf). although the association between csf and plasma measurements was modest, csf sst2, like plasma sst2, was elevated among patients with ad and positively associated with aβ plaque load in the frontal cortex, with greater effects in women than in men.having demonstrated a reproducible sex-specific association between sst2 and ad, jiang and colleagues next sought to identify the primary sources of variation in circulating sst2 levels. using plasma from chinese and european cohorts, as well as csf from a japanese cohort, the authors initially found that age and sex contributed to only about 7% and 13% of the variation in sst2 levels in plasma and csf, respectively. on the basis of previous work7 showing that sst2 may be regulated by variants in il1rl1, the gene encoding st2l and sst2, the authors employed whole-genome sequencing data to understand the genetic underpinnings of circulating sst2 levels. using a suggestive threshold, the authors found 577 genetic loci that together accounted for 55% of the variation in plasma concentrations of sst2. strikingly, one of the putative causal variants, rs1921622 (g/a) — located in the intronic region of st2l — accounted for 18% of the variation in plasma and csf sst2 levels. compared to the rs1921622 g/g reference group, carriers of the adenine allele (rs1921622 a) had approximately 20% lower sst2 levels in an allele dose-dependent manner.after finding this genetic variant, jiang and colleagues then asked how it may account for the decreased sst2 levels in the csf and plasma of rs1921622 a carriers. the authors confirmed that sst2 transcription was blunted in multiple brain regions of those carrying the rs1921622 aallele, while data from single-nucleus rna sequencing suggested these transcripts were primarily expressed by brain endothelial cells. indeed, those carrying the rs1921622 a allele had lower levels of sst2 transcripts in endothelial cells as well as fewer sst2-expressing endothelial cells, in an allele dose-dependent manner. further analyses using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and crispr–cas9 deletion of rs1921622 in a human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line demonstrated that this noncoding variant is likely to contribute to the regulation of sst2 expression through its role as an enhancer element of il1rl1.to test the causal relationship between sst2 and ad, the authors then turned to nature’s clinical trial: mendelian randomization. when rs1921622 and other genetic loci were used as proxies for sst2 variation across eight chinese and european cohorts, analyses supported a causal relationship between higher sst2 levels and increased ad risk in female apoeε4 carriers, a pattern that did not extend to men or individuals without the apoeε4 allele. remarkably, the protective genetic variant linked to lower levels of sst2 (rs1921622 a) was itself associated with lower ad risk, delayed age of onset, better cognition, larger entorhinal cortex volume and slower gray matter atrophy in female, but not male, apoeε4 carriers. both mendelian randomization and single-variant analyses found that the relationship between sst2 and ad risk was considerably stronger in the population with chinese ancestry than in european descendants. these findings suggest that the effects of sst2 may differ on the basis of ethnicity and underscore the value of such multiethnic analyses.what about microglia? with convincing evidence in hand for a mechanistic role of sst2 in ad, as well as previous knowledge that il-33–st2l signaling modulates microglial phagocytic capacity, the investigators next asked whether the protective genetic locus underlying sst2 might influence microglia functioning and the deposition of pathological aβ plaques. initial examination of postmortem tissue from the frontal cortex revealed that female apoeε4 carriers bore a greater aβ burden and lower microglial coverage of amyloid plaques. despite this headwind, female apoeε4 carriers who possessed the protective rs1921622 a allele (and thus maintained lower sst2 levels) had significantly less aβ deposition, along with greater microglial sequestration of amyloid plaques. consistent with this apparent microglial clearance of aβ plaques, the expression profile of microglia among rs1921622 a carriers reflected an upregulated phagocytic capacity (increased expression of the activation genes cd74, apoe and trem2; decreased expression of the homeostatic genes srgap2, tmem199 and p2ry12). from this, jiang and colleagues surmised that, in female apoeε4 carriers, the protective effect of the rs1921622 a allele can be exerted via decreased sst2 levels, which seem to trigger microglia to kick up their phagocytosis of aβ plaques.to validate the functional implications of sst2, the authors went on to examine the consequences of increasing sst2 in the brains of a mouse model of familial ad. compared to female mice injected with a control solution, mice that received chronic intracerebroventricular administration of recombinant sst2 showed impaired microglial coverage and uptake of aβ, resulting in accumulation of filamentous and compact aβ plaques. echoing the finding that the association between csf sst2 levels and aβ plaques was more pronounced in female than male humans with ad, the increase in aβ plaque loads after injection of sst2 was not observed in male mice. with these results in hand, the authors concluded that increased sst2 levels in the brains of female apoeε4 carriers are likely to limit the extent to which microglia can clear aβ plaques, thereby leading to increased aβ accumulation and increasing ad risk (fig. 1).under basal conditions, il-33 signaling via the st2l receptor triggers microglia to ingest and degrade aβ, a pathological protein that contributes to alzheimer’s disease. jiang and colleagues show how circulating soluble st2 (sst2), a decoy il-33 receptor that inhibits il-33–st2l signaling, can block microglia from clearing aβ among women most susceptible to alzheimer’s disease — those carrying the apoeε4 allele. conversely, the authors identify a genetic variant (rs1921622 a) that leads to decreased sst2 levels, resulting in enhanced microglial clearance of aβ and decreased alzheimer’s disease risk among female apoeε4 carriers. together, these results highlight a novel biomarker and target for alzheimer’s disease that calls for future investigation. bbb, blood–brain barrier.one question left open by the current results is whether the ad risk associated with sst2 is due solely to its role as a decoy receptor for its ligand (il-33) or to potential alternative cellular mechanisms. the authors highlight that the increased sst2 in the current study is likely to interact with its complementary ligand, il-33, thereby inhibiting il-33–st2l-mediated clearance of aβ by microglia and enhancing disease risk. although this explanation seems the most parsimonious, evidence indicates that other decoy receptors can similarly increase microglia aβ clearance and exert neuroprotective effects independent of their ligand — by, for example, interacting with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on microglia or binding to aβ directly8,9.another outstanding question relates to the biological basis of the striking sex difference in how sst2 relates to ad risk and neurocognitive outcomes. does variation in sst2 levels become biologically and clinically relevant only in the context of exceedingly high brain aβ levels and suboptimal microglia functioning? the current study and previous research10,11 suggest that women harboring the apoeε4 variant are most likely to fit into this category. in any case, understanding the mechanistic basis of the sex differences found in this study will undoubtedly shed light on the biology underlying ad pathogenesis, particularly the reason for increased vulnerability among older women.the current integrative study design provides convincing evidence that the regulation of sst2 is an ad-causing factor among female apoeε4 carriers. while the authors report increased levels of sst2 associated with ad risk and pathological features across multiple cohorts, a genetic variant (rs1921622 a) appears to protect against ad by mitigating sst2 expression and triggering microglia clearance of aβ among women carrying the apoeε4 allele, who are particularly susceptible to ad. in demonstrating how increasing levels of circulating sst2 accompanied by impaired microglia-aβ clearance can confer increased risk for ad, the results presented by jiang and colleagues highlight a potentially novel biomarker and target for ad that calls for future investigation.duggan, m. r. & parikh, v. behav. brain res. 405,
