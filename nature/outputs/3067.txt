analyses of the 2014 iceland–holuhraun volcanic eruption revealed the emitted aerosols induced a 10% increase in cloud coverage above the region, suggesting anthropogenic aerosols might strongly cool the earth’s climate by increasing the cloud coverage.you have full access to this article via your institution.man-made greenhouse gases drive the current climate change. to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, rapid and large-scale reductions in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are essential. fossil fuel burning is the largest contributor to man-made greenhouse gas emissions and, therefore, a shift away from fossil fuel use is urgently needed. however, fossil fuel burning also produces atmospheric aerosols — tiny solid and liquid air pollution particles floating around in our atmosphere. in contrast to the warming effect of greenhouse gases, atmospheric aerosols cool the climate. but the fraction of warming offset by cooling from aerosols has been poorly quantified thus far1. in particular, the interactions between atmospheric aerosols and clouds are not well understood. writing in nature geoscience, chen et al.2 find that aerosols not only cool the earth’s climate by reducing the size of cloud droplets but also by increasing the cloud coverage.correlative studies have previously indicated increased liquid cloud coverage in polluted conditions. however, such correlation alone does not necessarily reflect a causal relationship, as it can be caused by meteorological covariability — weather favouring higher pollution levels also favours higher cloud coverage3. chen et al.2 overcome the limitations of correlative studies by analysing the iceland–holuhraun effusive volcanic eruption in 2014 (fig. 1), which is a natural experiment for studying cloud responses to aerosols. the volcanic eruption induced a large aerosol plume in an environment with little anthropogenic pollution. the emission rates of sulfur dioxide reached levels similar to those seen over europe and north america in the 1970s4,5. this makes the iceland–holuhraun event an excellent testbed for studying the impacts of aerosols on clouds and earth’s climate.chen et al.2 reveal a substantial increase in cloud coverage in response to volcanic aerosols, suggesting that the climate cooling effect of aerosol pollution may be underestimated.chen and colleagues compare polluted cloud properties observed by a satellite during the volcanic eruption to the unpolluted clouds. as the active volcano meant that unpolluted conditions were impossible to observe in 2014, they use machine learning to predict the hypothetical cloud properties based on the observed weather, assuming the volcano had not erupted. the machine learning model is trained by observed weather and cloud properties during the unpolluted period of 2001 to 2020. chen et al.2 show that their model is reliable as it beautifully reproduces the historical conditions.in their work, chen and colleagues confirm part of the results of previous studies on the holuhraun volcano experiment — aerosols decrease the size of cloud droplets without a noticeable effect on cloud thickness4,6. the formation of smaller cloud droplets, due to the distribution of cloud water among a larger number of condensation sites, helps clouds reflect more solar energy back into space7. in contrast to the previous studies of the holuhraun eruption4,6, chen et al.2 report a 10% increase in the coverage of liquid water clouds. this finding is important because even a slight increase in the coverage of low-level clouds can lead to a significant cooling effect on earth’s climate as more solar energy bounces back into space1. the authors find that the climate cooling effect by increased cloud coverage exceeds that by reduced size of cloud droplets.a relatively strong increase in cloud coverage, in response to aerosols found by chen and colleagues, suggests that contemporary climate models might underestimate the aerosol-induced increases in cloud coverage. therefore, aerosols might have masked a larger part of the warming imposed by greenhouse gases than previously appreciated. thus, earth’s climate might be more sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions than currently thought. this would be bad news. a higher-than-expected climate sensitivity would require lower-than-expected emissions to stay under the 2 °c global warming limit. it would also become more likely for committed warming, induced by historical emissions alone, to exceed 1.5 °c (ref. 8).chen et al.2 provide compelling evidence for increased cloud coverage in response to aerosol emissions. however, the physical mechanism behind the cloud coverage increase remains unclear. suppression of precipitation by aerosols could be the reason, but then an increase in cloud thickness would also be expected. to put stronger constraints on the magnitude of cooling associated with aerosols, future work is needed to better understand the physical processes underlying the interactions between aerosols and clouds. given that the interactions between aerosols and clouds may still hold surprises, we need to prepare for the possibility that the earth’s climate might warm faster than our best estimates suggest.bellouin, n. et al. rev. geophys. 58, e2019rg000660 (2020).article google scholar chen, y. et al. nat. geosci.
