research capacity has grown rapidly, and now quality is on the rise.china’s blazing economic growth has cooled in recent years, but the nation’s scientific ambitions show no signs of fading. in 2000, china spent about as much on research and development (r&d) as france; now it invests more in this area than the european union does, when adjusted for the purchasing power of its currency. that surge in funding has paid off. china now produces more research articles than any other nation, apart from the united states, and its authors feature on around one-fifth of the world’s most-cited papers. top chinese scientific institutions are breaking into lists of the world’s best, and the nation has created some unparalleled facilities.there’s room for improvement within that bright picture. china steers much less of its r&d funding towards basic research than do many science power­houses, and its international collaboration rates are on the low side. the scholarly impact of its papers is improving rapidly, yet it remains below the world’s average. and although china boasts more than 1.5 million researchers, that’s a small number given its vast population. the country’s leaders recognize some of the weaknesses and have pledged to increase funding for science and technology, aiming particularly to stimulate innovation.an earlier version of this article erred in stating that china’s population is more than 1.3 trillion.you can also search for this author in pubmed google scholar tweet facebook linkedin weibo wechat  the future of chinese research 2016-jun-22  bioethics in china: no wild east 2016-jun-22  science in china 2016-jun-22  china’s bid to be a dna superpower 2016-jun-22  policy: boost basic research in china 2016-jun-22  science stars of china 2016-jun-20  second chinese team reports gene editing in human embryos 2016-apr-08  what china’s latest five-year plan means for science 2016-mar-18  china’s quantum space pioneer: we need to explore the unknown 2016-jan-13  china embraces precision medicine on a massive scale 2016-jan-06  china’s dark-matter satellite launches era of space science 2015-dec-17  nature special: science in china reprints and permissionsvan noorden, r. china by the numbers. nature 534, 452–453 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/534452adownload citationpublished: 22 june 2016issue date: 23 june 2016doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/534452aanyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative scientometrics (2021)science china life sciences (2019)scientometrics (2018)scientometrics (2017)scientometrics (2017)
