article via your institution.while fossil fuels currently fulfil our energy needs, renewable energies will play an increasing role. green hydrogen could be produced at scale from renewable electricity and back-converted to electricity on demand in fuel cells. polymer electrolyte fuel cells are well suited for automotive and other applications that require a quick start. owing to its high-ph environment, the hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (hemfc) holds promise to work efficiently with electrocatalysts based on abundant and cheap chemical elements1. although it has been recently demonstrated that several fe–n–c cathode catalysts show high performance in an hemfc2,3, the development of active anode catalysts for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (hor) without platinum group metals (pgms) remains a challenge4,5.now, writing in nature materials, weiyan ni and co-workers6 report how nickel nanoparticles can be made highly active towards the hor in high-ph electrolyte. they demonstrate a peak power of about 450 w cm–2 at 80 °c with a h2/o2 hemfc comprising their optimized nickel-based anode catalyst paired with a co–mn–ox cathode catalyst (fig. 1a)6. the highest peak power reported previously for an hemfc at 80 °c with a pgm-free anode was about 350 mw cm–2, but this was achieved with a pgm-based cathode (fig. 1b)7. the highest peak power reported hitherto on pgm-free hemfcs is about 80 mw cm–2 (ref. 8), highlighting the size of the step forward achieved by ni and co-workers.a, hemfc polarization curves at 80 °c with the ni–h2–nh3 and a co–mn–ox spinel

matrix were prepared via annealing at 390 °c in a reducing atmosphere a metal–organic framework composed of ni2+ cations and benzenetricarboxylate ligands (btc), ni3(btc)2. the highest hor activity was obtained with a h2:nh3:n2 annealing atmosphere. nh3 was key to nitrogen dope the carbon phase derived from organic ligands, as well as minimizing the size of the nickel particles. h2 combined with nh3 was necessary to increase graphitization and hence the electron conductivity of the carbon phase obtained by annealing ni3(btc)2 (fig. 2a). transmission electron microscopy images of the optimized catalyst (ni–h2–nh3) revealed separated zero-valence nickel nanoparticles of about 13 nm in size embedded in a carbon matrix (fig. 1c). the authors demonstrated with surface-sensitive techniques that an electronic interaction takes place between the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix and the nickel nanoparticles, this interaction probably being magnified by the extended interface between the nickel nanoparticles and the n–c matrix (solid blue lines in fig. 1c). ultraviolet photon spectroscopy, in particular, showed a weakened adsorption strength for the three materials derived from ni3(btc)2 relative to a metallic nickel reference. the catalyst morphology and composition (about 83 wt% ni, remainder c and n) are also different compared with the previous best nickel-based hor catalyst, composed of nicu alloy nanoparticles supported on undoped carbon (about 13 wt% ni, 1.5 wt% cu and 86 wt% c) (fig. 1d).a, nickel nanoparticles with a carbonaceous shell, requiring sufficient electronic conductivity of the shell. b, a single nickel-core and porous carbon-shell particle, here denoted by the grey coating. c, possible decreased solvation shell of oh− in idealized nanopores.after normalization to the electrochemically accessible nickel surface area, the surface-specific hor activity of ni–h2–nh3 was about 2.5 times higher than the most active nickel-based hor catalyst reported hitherto9. modification of the electronic state of nickel by interaction with the n–c shell seems to play an important role in tuning hydrogen- and hydroxyl-binding energies on nickel, which certainly partly explains the high hor activity observed (fig. 2b).other phenomena may, however, need to be invoked to account for the improved hor activity of nickel in this material. as the nickel nanoparticles seem to be fully covered by a n–c shell of typically 2–3 nm (figs. 1c and 2b,c) and the electrochemically measured surface area of nickel is commensurate with that expected for spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of 13 nm, this implies that the n–c shells are porous, allowing the passage of h2, oh− and h2o species (fig. 2b,c). the nickel surface is therefore accessible to electrolyte and reagents, while having a substantial density of electrical junctions with the n–c shell (fig. 2c). the electronic percolation path throughout the catalyst powder seems to be secured by the n–c shells, as supported by the low electronic conductivity of the ni3(btc)2 metal–organic framework annealed in n2/nh3. a morphology similar to that of ni–h2–nh3 was observed, but the n–c phase was more disordered, leading to a roughly ten-times lower electronic conductivity relative to ni–h2–nh3.the peculiar architecture of the nickel/n–c/electrolyte interface achieved by ni and co-workers therefore may have triggered unusual physicochemical phenomena. first, if the pores in the n–c shell are sufficiently small (nanometre range), this could lead to confinement effects, decreasing the solvation shell of hydroxyl anions by a non-negligible interaction between ions or water molecules and pore walls. it is well established, for example, that decreased solvation of ions in nanoporous carbon materials leads to increased electrochemical capacitance10. the cavities existing in the pristine ni3(btc)2 metal–organic framework (5 å and 9 å)11 may well have been transferred to the n–c shells derived from its annealing at 390 °c. second, the presence of many junctions between n–c shells and the metallic nickel interface (fig. 2c) may support the so-called bifunctional mechanism for the hor, wherein some sites promote h2 dissociation into two adsorbed hydrogen atoms whereas other sites bind hydroxyl anions, with these combined features being desirable to carry out the hor: h2 + 2oh− → 2h2o + 2e−.encapsulation of metallic nickel nanoparticles by a thin but nanoporous shell of nitrogen-doped conductive carbon may therefore be at the root of the high performance. in a broader sense, some analogy can be drawn with the recently reported modified selectivity of metallic platinum when it is covered by an overlayer of porous tiox (ref. 12). the improved selectivity for the hor relative to dioxygen electro-reduction reaction of pt@tiox versus bare platinum was tentatively assigned to a sieving effect due to the pore network of the tiox overlayer. the preparation of porous shells with tunable and well-controlled pore size is generally desirable for improved understanding and optimized activity or selectivity of such materials. indeed, a set of materials with varying (controlled) pore sizes could unambiguously demonstrate the validity of any solvation shell effects, with no effect expected above a certain pore size.the preparation by design of core@porous-shell materials could therefore find promising applications in electrocatalysis, enabling low-cost catalysts and further improvements in the activity, selectivity and/or stability of pgm-based catalysts. the work by ni and co-workers certainly suggests that this would be a fruitful area of research.adabi, h. & mustain, w. e. acs catal. 10, 225–234 (2020).article google scholar adabi, h. et al. nat.
