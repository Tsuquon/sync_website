dual-atom catalysts show potential for complex reactions, but their controllable preparation is challenging. a method to transform a ni nanoparticle into a ni2n6 dual-atom structure on a carbon support yields a catalyst with precisely controlled atomic site distances, giving excellent performance for co2 electroreduction.the combustion of fossil fuels to meet the global energy demand has resulted in uncertainty in energy supplies and increased co2 emissions, causing environmental damage. the electrochemical co2 reduction reaction (co2rr) is an opportunity to close the carbon cycle and store renewable energy in chemical bonds. for the multi-intermediate co2rr, catalysts play an essential role in accelerating reaction kinetics and steering product selectivity1. amongst various products, co is an important building block for the chemicals industry, for example in the fischer–tropsch reaction and the hydroformylation reaction2.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.panel c was reproduced from ref. 8, springer nature ltd.ross, m. b. et al. nat. catal. 2, 648–658 (2019).cas article google scholar bierhals, j. ullmann’s encycl. ind. chem. 6, 565–582 (2012). google scholar gao, d., liu, t., wang, g. & bao, x. acs energy lett. 6, 713–727 (2021).cas article google scholar he, z. et al. nano lett. 14, 3766–3772 (2014).cas article google scholar li, l. b., yuan, k. & chen, y. w. acc. mater. res. 3, 584–596 (2022).cas article google scholar jin, z. et al. nat. catal. 4, 615–622 (2021).cas article google scholar mitchell, s. & pérez-ramírez, j. nat. rev. mater. 6, 969–985 (2021).article google scholar hao, q. et al. nat. synth. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00138-w (2022).article google scholar download referencesschool of materials science and engineering, peking university, beijing, chinashuguang wang, mingchuan luo & shaojun guoyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to shaojun guo.the authors declare no competing interests.reprints and permissionswang, s., luo, m. & guo, s. two atoms are better than one. nat. synth (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00140-2download citationpublished: 18 august 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00140-2anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
