the hippo pathway is a key regulator of tissue homeostasis, organ size and cancer. identification of microcolin b and its analog molecules as hippo pathway activators connects ptdins4p-dependent lipid signaling with the hippo pathway, suggesting potential targets for cancer therapy.you have full access to this article via your institution.the hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway known for its crucial roles in development, regeneration, organ size control and tissue homeostasis1. the major downstream effectors restricted by the hippo pathway, yap and taz, are two transcriptional coactivators that orchestrate the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. yap and taz are highly expressed and activated in various types of human cancer2, suggesting that hippo pathway dysregulation may contribute to cancer and that compounds targeting this pathway could have therapeutic roles in cancer. therefore, further elucidating the regulation of this key signaling pathway not only will enrich our understanding of multiple key biological processes, but also is likely to provide new opportunities for cancer treatment.in the past two decades, great efforts have been made to find compounds that can activate the hippo pathway to target yap and taz3; however, progress has been slow and limited, ultimately resulting in no options worth pursuing in a clinical setting. in this issue of nature chemical biology, li et al. now report on microcolin b (mcb) and its modified analogs, which function as hippo pathway activators that target phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins α and β (pitpα/β) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (ptdins4p)4, providing new pharmacological drug candidates for treating yap-dependent cancer.to discover small-molecule regulators for the hippo pathway, li et al. screened a chemical library containing 139 naturally derived marine compounds and identified mcb (fig. 1a) as a hippo pathway activator, as evidenced by its ability to induce yap phosphorylation and inhibit yap4. by optimizing the structure of mcb, the authors developed an mcb analog, vt01454 (fig. 1a), that is a potent hippo pathway activator. importantly, both mcb and vt01454 largely inhibited the proliferation and viability of yap-dependent cancer cells but showed limited effect on yap-independent cancer cells, providing cell-line-based evidence for their therapeutic potential. using a proteomic approach, the authors identified pitpα/β as the primary binding proteins of vt01454 (fig. 1b) and demonstrated that their inhibition conveyed the vt01454-induced hippo pathway activation4. taking into consideration the critical roles of pitpα/β in transferring er-synthesized phosphatidylinositol (ptdins), the authors further delineated this pi-based lipid pathway by showing that pitpα/β-mediated pi plasma membrane transport and subsequent ptdins4p production at the plasma membrane are key events in hippo pathway inhibition (fig. 1c). in line with this notion, both vt01454-treated cells and pitpα/β-deficient cells displayed reduced ptdins4p on the plasma membrane, whereas enhancing ptdins4p levels by manipulating the interconversion of ptdins phosphates (pips) inhibited the hippo pathway. collectively, the work by li et al.4 not only identifies a group of small molecules as effective yap inhibitors, but also unveils previously unknown functions of pitpα/β and ptdins4p in regulating the hippo pathway.a–d, the hippo pathway activators microcolin b (mcb) and its potent analog vt01454 (a) bind and inhibit phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins α and β (pitpα/β) (b), which alters phosphatidylinositol (pi) plasma membrane transport (c) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (ptdins4p) production on the plasma membrane (d). ptdins4p is a negative regulator of the hippo pathway, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear (d). e, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (ptdins(4,5)p2) activates the hippo pathway by recruiting nf2 to the plasma membrane. f, lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) act via g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) and rho gtpase to inhibit the hippo pathway. g, phosphatidic acid (pa) targets the hippo pathway by binding lats and nf2 to target lats–mob1 complex formation and nf2-mediated lats membrane translocation, respectively. er, endoplasmic reticulum; ptdins(3,4,5)p3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate.this interesting work provides a molecular basis for applying mcb and its analog vt01454 to the treatment of yap-dependent cancer. it will be important to determine their therapeutic efficacy using animal models and also to evaluate potential off-target and/or side-effect issues during treatment. notably, mcb was originally discovered as an immunosuppressive natural product5; therefore, whether potential immune-system-associated side effects might affect the therapeutic outcome of mcb and vt01454 deserves further investigation.the discovery of pitpα/β and ptdins4p as new hippo pathway regulators underscores the key regulatory roles of pips in this pathway. ptdins is synthesized at the er and transported by pitpα/β to the plasma membrane, where it is further converted to ptdins4p and other pips. therefore, pitpα/β have important roles in modulating pip-dependent signaling events, including the hippo pathway as discovered here. by contrast, precisely how ptdins4p controls the hippo pathway is still largely unknown (fig. 1d). one potential clue is revealed here through the finding that the hippo upstream component nf2 is required for ptdins4p-mediated hippo pathway inhibition4 and can also directly bind ptdins4p6. however, in addition to ptdins4p, nf2 also interacts with other pips6, among which ptdins(4,5)p2 is required for nf2 plasma membrane localization and hippo pathway activation7 (fig. 1e). these facts together suggest complex roles of pips acting upstream of the hippo pathway.phospholipids and their enzymatic regulators have emerged as crucial components and regulators for the hippo pathway because of their important roles in mediating membrane dynamics and various growth-related signaling events. for example, lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine-1-phosphate have mitogenic and growth-factor-like activities that act via g-protein-coupled receptors to inhibit the hippo pathway8,9 (fig. 1f). as mentioned above, ptdins(4,5)p2 binds and recruits nf2 to the plasma membrane to activate the hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress7 (fig. 1e). in addition, phosphatidic acid directly binds nf2 and the hippo kinase lats to inhibit nf2-mediated lats membrane translocation and the association of lats with its adaptor protein mob1, respectively, resulting in hippo pathway inhibition10 (fig. 1g). together with these facts, the work by li et al.4 further advances our understanding of phospholipids in hippo pathway regulation. as many phospholipid-related enzymes are druggable, further investigating phospholipids in hippo pathway regulation will provide additional therapeutic opportunities for treating yap-dependent cancers.zheng, y. & pan, d. dev. cell 50, 264–282 (2019).cas article google scholar zanconato, f., cordenonsi, m. & piccolo, s. cancer cell 29, 783–803 (2016).cas article google scholar dey, a., varelas, x. & guan, k. l. nat. rev. drug discov. 19, 480–494 (2020).cas article google scholar li, f. l. et al. nat. chem. biol. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01061-z (2022).koehn, f. e., longley, r. e. & reed, j. k. j. nat. prod. 55, 613–619 (1992).cas article google scholar mani, t. et al. mol. cell. biol. 31, 1983–1996 (2011).cas article google scholar hong, a. w. et al. genes dev. 34, 511–525 (2020).cas article google scholar yu, f. x. et al. cell 150, 780–791 (2012).cas article google scholar miller, e. et al. chem. biol. 19, 955–962 (2012).cas article google scholar han, h. et al. mol. cell 72, 328–340 e8 (2018).cas article google scholar download referencesdepartment of developmental and cell biology, university of california, irvine, irvine, ca, usagayoung seo & wenqi wangyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to wenqi wang.the authors declare no competing interests.reprints and permissionsseo, g., wang, w. putting a leash on hippo. nat chem biol (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01066-8download citationpublished: 04 july 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01066-8anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
