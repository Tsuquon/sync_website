co-doping ytterbium and praseodymium ions in photon avalanche nanoparticles rapidly builds up huge optical nonlinearities, enabling confocal microscopy to achieve super-resolution imaging at high speed.you have full access to this article via your institution.generating a large optical nonlinearity from single nanoparticles is beneficial for a wide range of applications, including super-resolution imaging, realization of micro-/nanoscale lasers, and physical and chemical sensing at the nanoscale. for more than four decades, photon avalanche (pa)-induced nonlinearity has only been seen in bulk crystals and glasses doped with lanthanides, including pr3+, sm3+, nd3+, tm3+, er3+ and ho3+. only recently, pa has been observed from single upconversion nanoparticles (ucnps), where tm3+ doping led to the generation of up to 32nd-order optical nonlinearities1. the large nonlinearity enabled a scanning confocal microscope to achieve 70-nm resolution. however, the intrinsic long time, more than half a second, required to build up the pa effect significantly slows the recording time for imaging applications. as a consequence, a pixel dwelling time of tens to hundreds of milliseconds is typically needed.now, writing in nature nanotechnology, liang and co-workers report on a co-doping strategy to create a pa in core–shell ucnps with a rise time as short as 20 ms and nonlinearity up to the 46th order2. by leveraging the rapid response, imaging of intracellular actin filaments is demonstrated with a pixel dwell time of 0.1 ms and a spatial resolution of 71 nm.in their design, the team use a relatively low concentration of praseodymium (pr3+) ions, which are known to generate a pa in bulk materials. these ions have a relatively large cross-section at the intermediate excited state (1g4) and emit fast-decay luminescence from the upconversion excited states (3p0 and 3p1). the 852-nm laser excitation first populates pr3+ ions onto the intermediate state 1g4 via low-efficiency ground-state absorption (gsa) and then onto the upconversion states via a high-efficiency excited-state absorption (esa) process. the low doping concentration is designed to avoid deleterious cross-relaxation between the multiple energy levels of pr3+, which would quench the brightness of ucnps.however, cross-relaxation is necessary for pa, as an inter-ionic energy loop needs to be established, namely the turning of one upconversion excited-state ion and a ground-state ion into two intermediate excited-state ions. to activate efficient energy loops, the researchers innovatively introduce a high concentration of ytterbium ions (yb3+), optimized at 15 mol%. given that the simple energy structure of yb3+ ions matches well that of upconversion states (3p0 and 3p1) and the intermediate state (1g4) of pr3+, strong cross-relaxation between pr3+ and yb3+ ions exponentially populates yb3+ ions onto an excited state that consequently sensitizes pr3+ ions onto 1g4, and thereby, with the strong esa at 1g4, a positive avalanche loop is formed (fig. 1). as the energy-level structure of yb3+ is so simple, the detrimental cross-relaxation processes can be avoided, and the numbers of excited-state yb3+ and pr3+ ions can be built up within 20 ms.continuous-wave laser excitation at 852 nm perfectly matches the excited-state absorption in pr3+ ions, and the use of a high concentration of yb3+ ions enables the energy looping to rapidly establish a photon avalanche. 1, cross-relaxation; 2, energy transfer process.owing to the rapid build-up of nonlinearity, the ucnps lend themselves to biological imaging with low optical powers. liang and co-workers functionalized 26-nm diameter pa ucnps to selectively bind subcellular actin in hela cells, which were subsequently imaged in a standard raster-scan multiphoton microscope equipped with a 852-nm continuous-wave laser beam. fine structures of intracellular actin filaments were observed with a resolution of around 71 nm. this represents another major advance compared with their previous work using ucnps with a diameter of less than 12 nm to label microtubules3.moreover, the network of high concentrations of yb3+ ions does not only activate the pa loops, but also migrates the pa effect to sensitize other lanthanide ions located in the outer shell layer of the nanoparticle. this migration effect further builds up optical nonlinearities, up to the 46th order when the outer shell is doped with tm3+ ions. however, larger core–shell ucnps (60 nm versus 26 nm) were formed, which is not favourable for intracellular labelling4.it should be noted that a pa-like process with nonlinearities up to 7.2 has been previously reported5,6 in ucnps highly doped with 8 mol% tm3+, which enabled a single-beam confocal microscope to achieve lateral resolution of 184 nm7. the intense cross-relaxation between tm3+ ions enabled those in a higher excited energy level to transfer energy to a nearby tm3+ ion in the ground or lower energy level, forming a positive feedback process accelerating the accumulation of emitters in intermediate excited energy levels. unlike ordinary pa, however, the condition for non-resonant gsa is not met with co-doped ucnps containing yb3+ sensitizers and tm3+ emitters under the 980-nm excitation, so the threshold behaviour of pa is absent6. however, by using 1,064 nm for esa instead of gsa transitions, pre-avalanche energy looping in ucnps doped with 1.5 mol% tm3+ yielded nonlinearities of up to 3.2 (ref. 8).the judicious use of esa, high-concentration doping of lanthanide ions, and cross-relaxation-induced energy looping are all essential in establishing pa in ucnps with large optical nonlinearities. strategies including the use of high-irradiance excitation and inert-shell passivation are practical solutions to alleviate quenching at high concentrations of lanthanide ions as well as overcoming surface energy losses9. the high concentrations enable high efficiency of the cross-relaxation and energy transfer processes. together with strong esa, high quantum yields in pa ucnps (23% to 40%) were calculated, which are superior to that of typical ucnps using energy transfer upconversion.rapid build-up of large optical nonlinearities in ucnps with low thresholds will broadly benefit a series of recent developments in super-resolution techniques10,11, as well as nanoscale sensing applications, such as temperature12, pressure and ph. this is particularly true for emerging fields like nanothermometry, as the large nonlinearity promises ultra-high thermal sensitivity using sub-diffraction imaging techniques with fast temporal resolution, which is yet to be achieved. other potential applications of pa ucnps with large optical nonlinearities also include mid-infrared quantum-coherent frequency conversion13, optical data storage14, in vivo 3d bioprinting15 and high-resolution 3d photopolymerization16.lee, c. et al. nature
