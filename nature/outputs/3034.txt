observation of large remnant polarization in epitaxial yttrium-doped hafnium oxide thin films demonstrates that small-grained or ultrathin microstructures are not required to achieve robust ferroelectric behaviour.you have full access to this article via your institution.the surprising discovery that hafnium oxide (hfo2)-based thin films can be ferroelectric, first reported in 2011 by böscke et al.1, has spurred continually growing interest in understanding and optimizing the factors that control this behaviour. this is motivated both by the demonstrated compatibility of hfo2 with silicon-based electronic devices, and by the desire to find alternatives, in the applications of ferroelectrics, to the use of well-established, but environmentally unfriendly, lead-containing materials such as pbtio3 or pb(zrxti1−x)o3.ferroelectric materials exhibit switchable non-zero polarization. only materials with a non-centrosymmetric structure can be ferroelectric, which means that the thermodynamically stable cubic, tetragonal and monoclinic phases of hfo2 are not ferroelectric (fig. 1). previous studies have concluded that formation of a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic structure of hfo2, having space group pca21, is the key to realizing ferroelectric behaviour2, and thus determining the synthesis and processing conditions required to form this metastable phase has been the focus of many recent studies. a typical conclusion reached by many previous investigators is that ferroelectric behaviour in hfo2-based materials can be observed only in nanocrystalline films with an average grain size no larger than about 10 nm (ref. 3). while several recent reports have demonstrated that epitaxial single-crystal hfo2-based films can also exhibit ferroelectric behaviour, the remnant polarization (pr) values reported in those studies were no larger than about 15 μc cm−2 unless the films were limited to thicknesses of less than 10 nm (ref. 4). even for much thinner epitaxial films, the maximum pr value reported so far for hfo2-based ferroelectric materials is 34 μc cm−2 (refs. 5,6). similar maximum pr values have been reported for nanocrystalline hfo2-based films.xiaoshan xu.formation of a metastable, non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic structure of hfo2-based materials, shown schematically on the right, results in interesting ferroelectric behaviour. in contrast, hfo2-based materials exhibiting the high-temperature thermodynamically stable centrosymmetric tetragonal structure (left) would be expected to exhibit paraelectric behaviour.now, writing in nature materials, yu yan, pratyush buragohain and co-authors report that they have succeeded in preparing ferroelectric 10-nm-thick epitaxial (111)-oriented yttrium-doped hfo2 films that exhibit record-high room-temperature pr values7 (fig. 2), challenging the viewpoint that only ultrathin or nanocrystalline hfo2-based films can exhibit large ferroelectric polarization. the 5% yttrium-doped hfo2 films characterized in their study were grown by pulsed laser deposition onto (001)- or (110)-oriented single-crystal strontium titanium oxide (srtio3, sto) substrates, onto which an epitaxial lanthanum strontium manganese oxide (la0.7sr0.3mno3, lsmo) bottom electrode layer had first been grown. interestingly, (111)-oriented films were obtained when growing on either substrate orientation, and much larger room-temperature pr values were observed for films grown on (110)-oriented substrates (50 μc cm−2) than for films grown on (001)-oriented substrates (36 μc cm−2). optimizing the substrate temperature during growth, at constant oxygen partial pressure, was found to be important in achieving maximum pr for both substrate orientations.the epitaxial yttrium-doped hfo2 films grown on lsmo-coated (001) sto substrates by yun, buragohain and co-workers7 exhibit polarization-field hysteresis loops that indicate similarly large remnant polarization values as reported in previous studies of epitaxial hf0.5zr0.5o2 films that were also grown on lsmo-coated (001) sto substrates5,6, even though the yttrium-doped films characterized in this new study were thicker than the films examined in those earlier studies. this is noteworthy, as previous studies have consistently found that pr in hfo2-based films decreases rapidly with increasing film thickness. as seen here, films grown in this recent study also exhibited even larger remnant polarization values, at constant film thickness, when they were grown on (110)- rather than (001)-oriented sto substrates. this is especially surprising as growth on either orientation substrate results in (111)-oriented distorted orthorhombically structured films. yun, buragohain and co-workers hypothesize that the lower rotational symmetry of the sto (110) substrate surface compared with that of the sto (001) surface results in formation of fewer structurally equivalent domains in the yttrium-doped hfo2 films grown on sto (110) substrate surfaces, and thus higher film crystallinity, which they identify as a key to realizing the largest possible remnant polarization.yan, buragohain and colleagues also investigated whether the ferroelectric behaviour they observed is intrinsic to the epitaxially strained orthorhombic phase of their films, or, instead, is impacted significantly by extrinsic factors. for example, it was recently demonstrated that oxygen vacancy migration plays a dominant role in the polarization switching behaviour of hafnium zirconium oxide (hf0.5zr0.5o2) films8,9. in ref. 9, pr was observed to decrease by approximately a factor of three, to less than 10 μc cm−2, when the measurement temperature of hf0.5zr0.5o2 films was reduced from 300 k to 20 k (opposite in direction to the temperature dependence exhibited by classical perovskite-structured ferroelectrics), demonstrating that the polarization switching behaviour of those films is controlled by oxygen vacancy migration rather than being intrinsic in nature. in contrast, yan, buragohain and colleagues observed large, almost constant pr values at measurement temperatures below 100 k, demonstrating that the yttrium-doped hfo2 films they studied exhibited dominantly intrinsic behaviour.while the study of yan, buragohain and co-workers has provided a new perspective on the importance of grain size and film thickness in stabilizing and controlling the ferroelectric behaviour of hfo2-based materials, it will undoubtedly inspire additional studies addressing questions that remain unanswered, such as the following. for example, do yttrium-doped hfo2 films grown epitaxially on sto/lsmo show a similar strong decrease in pr seen in other hfo2-based films as the film thickness is substantially increased above 10 nm? as the structural mismatch between the orthorhombic hfo2 (111) surface and the cubic/pseudocubic sto/lsmo (001) and (110) surfaces results in the films having a domain structure, how does the presence of domain boundaries impact the ferroelectric behaviour, and what domain structures are formed in their films? finally, how is the doped-hfo2 film free surface charge-compensated, and can the polarization magnitude and direction be controlled by changing the environment in contact with the film? early studies of doped-hfo2 films1 found that the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase was only observed when a conducting top electrode film was present. would growth of a conducting top electrode on epitaxial yttrium-doped hfo2 films alter the charge-compensation mechanism (for example, by changing the concentration of charged oxygen vacancies near the surface), such that even larger pr could be achieved? future studies aimed at answering these and other questions may reveal even more surprises impacting the synthesis and applications promise of ferroelectric hfo2-based materials.böscke, t. s. et al. appl. phys. lett. 99, 102903 (2011).article google scholar schroeder, u. et al.
