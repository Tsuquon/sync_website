a mouse model of spontaneous arrhythmia in awake mice enables researchers to study how immune cells contribute to this process. the authors find opposing effects of the immune compartment, with neutrophils favoring arrhythmias by increasing oxidative stress and macrophages protecting against it via their phagocytic activity.electrical conduction disorders are a major clinical problem as they can lead to sudden cardiac death and afflict millions of individuals every year. although the underlying cause is not completely understood, previous pathologies such as myocardial ischemic events (or myocardial infarction, mi) increase the risk of these events1. research over the past decade has shown that mi and other stresses of the heart invoke the function of immune cells, but whether and how these cells also participate in the onset or severity of ventricular arrhythmias remains unknown. one reason for this has been the lack of suitable models that reproduce these phenomena in mice, thereby limiting the identification of molecular and cellular players of myocardial arrhythmia using the most popular animal model.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.srinivasan, n. t. & schilling, r. j. arrhythm. electrophysiol. rev. 7, 111 (2018).article google scholar hulsmans, m. et al. cell 169, 510–522.e20 (2017).cas article google scholar simões, f. c. et al. nat. commun. 11, 1–17 (2020).article google scholar kazbanov, i. v., ten tusscher, k. h. w. j. & panfilov, a. v. sci. rep. 6, 1–14 (2016).article google scholar grune, j. et al. nat. cardiovasc. res. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-022-00094-w (2022).article pubmed google scholar yan, x. et al. j. mol. cell. cardiol. 62, 24–35 (2013).cas article google scholar horckmans, m. et al. eur. heart j. 38, ehw002 (2016).article google scholar nicolás-ávila, j. a. et al. cell 183, 94–109.e23 (2020).article google scholar heidt, t. et al. circ. res. 115, 284–295 (2014).cas article google scholar lemke, g. nat. rev. immunol. 19, 539–549 (2019).cas article google scholar nicolás-ávila, j. a., pena-couso, l., muñoz-cánoves, p. & hidalgo, a. circ. res. 130, 418–431 (2022).article google scholar download referencescentro nacional de investigaciones cardiovasculares carlos iii, madrid, spainjosé ángel nicolás-ávila & andrés hidalgovascular biology and therapeutics program and department of immunobiology, yale university school of medicine, new haven, ct, usaandrés hidalgoyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to andrés hidalgo.a.h. is a paid consultor for flagship pioneering for matters partly related to this article.reprints and permissionsnicolás-ávila, j.á., hidalgo, a. immune riders on the cardiac storm. nat cardiovasc res 1, 603–604 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-022-00097-7download citationpublished: 11 july 2022issue date: july 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-022-00097-7anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
