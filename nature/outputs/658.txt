highs and lows in the country’s research landscape.indian science is a study in contrasts. with its vast population and rapidly expanding economy, the country has ramped up scientific production at an impressive rate. india started the twenty-first century well behind russia, france, italy and canada in terms of yearly publications and it now leads them all by healthy margins. it is quickly closing in on japan.despite those gains, india is not yet a major player in world science. its publications generate fewer citations on average than do those of other science-focused nations, including other emerging countries such as brazil and china. relative to its size, india has very few scientists; many indian-born researchers leave for positions abroad and very few foreign scientists settle in india. the country invests a scant portion of its economy in research and development (r&d), and it produces relatively few patents per capita compared with other nations.but there are bright spots. india boasts several world-class centres for science education, particularly the highly regarded indian institutes of technology. businesses in the country are investing more in r&d, which bodes well for future innovation. and more women are participating in science, although their numbers still fall far below those of men. top ten institutions the map of india accidentally omitted the state of meghalaya. this has now been corrected.a correction to this paper has been published: https://doi.org/10.1038/521407ayou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholar indian bioscience: the anti-bureaucrat 2015-may-13  science in india 2015-may-13  policy: rethink india's energy strategy 2015-may-13  india: the fight to become a science superpower 2015-may-13  research management: priorities for science in india 2015-may-13  a nation with ambition 2015-may-13  india’s budget disappoints scientists 2015-mar-02  policy: free indian science 2014-apr-02  nature special: science in india  department of science & technology reprints and permissionsvan noorden, r. india by the numbers. nature 521, 142–143 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1038/521142adownload citationpublished: 13 may 2015issue date: 14 may 2015doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/521142aanyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative science and engineering ethics (2016)nature (2015)
