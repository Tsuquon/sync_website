the current production of bulk chemicals often requires constant high temperatures. now, joule heating using electricity can be harnessed by imposing temperature modulation on reactions. by optimizing timescales, reaction selectivity and catalyst stability is improved.the rate at which chemical reactions proceed increases exponentially with temperature according to the arrhenius law. hence, to limit space and reduce costs, most large-scale industrial processes are performed at temperatures between 500 and 1,300 k. currently, fossil fuels are combusted and heat is transferred by radiation and convection to achieve these temperatures. the use of combustion furnaces requires high surface areas for heat exchange1 and is responsible for 400 to 500 million tons of co2 emissions every year. heterogeneous catalysts increase reaction rates and can increase reaction selectively by favouring the desired reaction over side reactions. however, catalyst deactivation as a result of high temperatures is often challenging.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.bonheure, m., vandewalle, l. a., marin, g. b. & van geem, k. m. chem. eng. prog. 117, 37–42 (2021). google scholar dong, q. et al. nature 605, 470–476 (2022).cas article google scholar boudart, m. top catal. 1, 405–414 (1994).cas article google scholar van geem, k. m., galvita, v. v. & marin, g. b. science 364, 734–735 (2019).article google scholar silveston, p. l. & hudgins, r. r. chem. eng. sci. 59, 4043–4053 (2004).cas article google scholar marin, g. b., galvita, v. v. & yablonsky, g. s. j. catal. 404, 745–759 (2021).cas article google scholar brandner, j. j., emig, g., liauw, m. a. & schubert, k. chem. eng. j. 101, 217–224 (2004).cas article google scholar wismann, s. t. et al. science. 364, 756–759 (2019).cas article google scholar ardagh, m. a., abdelrahman, o. a. & dauenhauer, p. j. acs catal. 9, 6929–6937 (2019).cas article google scholar shetty, m. et al. acs catal. 10, 12666–12695 (2020).cas article google scholar download referenceslaboratory for chemical technology (lct), department of materials, textiles and chemical engineering, faculty of engineering & architecture, ghent university, zwijnaarde, belgiumguy b. marin & kevin m. van geemyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to kevin m. van geem.the authors declare no competing interests.reprints and permissionsmarin, g.b., van geem, k.m. electrified temperature-modulated synthesis. nat. synth 1, 512–513 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00112-6download citationpublished: 08 july 2022issue date: july 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00112-6anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
