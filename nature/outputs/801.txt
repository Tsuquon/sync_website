a graphical tour through the history of the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the science that underlies it.the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) was founded 25 years ago to provide authoritative assessments on the emerging problem of climate change. since its first report in 1990, the ipcc has issued increasingly complex follow-ups about every six years. the climate models that feed into the assessments have grown bigger and better, but researchers have not succeeded in reducing some key uncertainties about climate change. where the reports have grown most firm is in declaring that humans are causing the world to warm. you can also search for this author in pubmed google scholar ipcc: the climate chairman 2013-sep-18  global warming: outlook for earth 2013-sep-18  the final assessment 2013-sep-18  history: pushing the climate frontier 2013-sep-18  climate change: a patchwork of emissions cuts 2013-sep-18  climate science: rising tide 2013-sep-18  nature special: outlook for earth 25 years of the ipccreprints and permissionsjones, n. climate assessments: 25 years of the ipcc. nature 501, 298â€“299 (2013). https://doi.org/10.1038/501298adownload citationpublished: 18 september 2013issue date: 19 september 2013doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/501298aanyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative environmental science and pollution research (2022)climatic change (2016)nature (2014)
