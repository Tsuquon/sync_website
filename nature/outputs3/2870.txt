heteroepitaxial growth of single-crystal films typically requires stringent matching of the specific lattice ordering with the underlying substrate. now, amorphous mote2 thin films are shown to transform into wafer-scale 2d single-crystals through seeded growth on the surface of any arbitrary substrate.as conventional silicon electronics rapidly approach their fundamental scaling limit, 2d semiconductors are attracting tremendous interest because of their atomically thin geometry and their theoretically ultimate scaling potential1,2. studies of 2d semiconductors typically rely on exfoliated flakes from bulk crystals, which, although versatile, are rarely scalable. recently, there have been increasing efforts to achieve the scalable growth of 2d semiconducting single-crystals3. controlling reaction conditions to reduce nucleation density is one way to enable the growth of millimetre-scale single-crystal domains4. however, the wafer-scale growth of 2d single-crystals remains a challenge as a consequence of the random nucleation of different crystal domains on substrates. heteroepitaxial growth of 2d crystals, such as ws2 and mos2, on single-crystal substrates with an exposed matching lattice (for example, a sapphire substrate with a specific cut direction) has resulted in the fabrication of single-crystalline 2d thin films on the wafer-scale5,6. however, the applicability and cost-effectiveness of this approach are limited by the requirements of the specific substrate.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.panel b is adapted from ref. 9 and panel c is adapted from ref. 10, springer nature ltd.duan, x., wang, c., pan, a., yu, r. & duan, x. chem. soc. rev. 44, 8859–8876 (2015).liu, y. et al. nature 591, 43–53 (2021).cas article google scholar xu, x. et al. adv. mater. 34, 2108258 (2022).cas article google scholar zhang, z. et al. nat. sci. rev. 7, 737–744 (2020).wang, j. et al. nat. nanotechnol. 17, 33–38 (2022).cas article google scholar liu, l. et al. nature 605, 69–75 (2022).cas article google scholar pan, y. et al. nat. synth. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00134-0 (2022).article google scholar duerloo, k.-a. n., li, y. & reed, e. j. nat. commun. 5, 4214 (2014).keum, d. et al. nat. phys. 11, 482–486 (2015).cas article google scholar huang, j.-h. et al. sci. rep. 9, 8810 (2019).article google scholar park, j. c. et al. acs nano 9, 6548–6554 (2015).cas article google scholar xu, x. et al. j. am. chem. soc. 141, 2128–2134 (2019).cas article google scholar shimura, f. in springer handbook of electronic and photonic materials (eds kasap, s. & capper, p.) ch. 13 (springer, cham, 2017).download referencesdepartment of materials science and engineering, university of california los angeles, los angeles, ca, usahuaying ren & yu huangdepartment of chemistry and biochemistry, university of california los angeles, los angeles, ca, usahuaying ren & xiangfeng duancalifornia nanosystems institute, university of california los angeles, los angeles, ca, usaxiangfeng duan & yu huangyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to yu huang.the authors declare no competing interests.reprints and permissionsren, h., duan, x. & huang, y. any surface will do. nat. synth (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00154-wdownload citationpublished: 25 august 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00154-wanyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
