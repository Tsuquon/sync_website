quantifying historical trends in tropical cyclone activity has proved difficult, but a new reconstruction reveals a clear global decline over the past century, driven by an increasingly cyclone-hostile environment in the troposphere.you have full access to this article via your institution.tropical cyclones, including hurricanes and typhoons, rank among the costliest natural hazards. understanding how — and why — tropical cyclone activity is changing globally in a warming climate is profoundly important. however, the large natural variability of tropical cyclone frequency, combined with only a few decades of reliable, satellite-era observational data, make quantifying long-term historical trends and attributing trends to natural versus anthropogenic factors substantial scientific challenges. writing in nature climate change, savin s. chand et al1. report their reconstruction of a global, long-term record of tropical cyclone frequency stretching back to 1850 and identify significant downward trends over the twentieth century. their analysis shows that the global tropospheric environment has become increasingly hostile to tropical cyclone formation over the past century, driving this decline.tropical cyclones are born from ‘seeds’ — tropical waves or rotating clusters of individual thunderstorms — over a period of hours to weeks. this occurs at low latitudes over warm tropical oceans and, usually, at least 1,000 km from the equator, where planetary rotation is sufficient to aggregate convective activity into a coherent vortex. once formed, tropical cyclones typically move westwards and polewards before reaching the mid-latitudes, where a cooler ocean surface weakens them or they transform into extratropical weather systems.climate change is expected to affect the thermodynamic conditions that engender tropical cyclones, altering the frequency2,3, intensity4,5,6, spatial distribution5,7,8 and seasonality4,9 of these storms. quantifying historical trends and projecting changes over the coming decades remain subjects of intense research. globally, researchers have identified poleward shifts in the latitude at which tropical cyclones form10 and reach their maximum intensity5, and an increasing proximity of storms’ maximum intensity to coastal regions8. therefore, geographical shifts in where tropical cyclone landfall can occur may be already spreading risks to regions previously seldom hit. the proportion of intense tropical cyclones has increased over recent decades2,6,11, and the number of north atlantic tropical cyclones reaching the mid-latitudes may also be rising12. when hurricane sandy struck the greater new york metropolitan area in 2012, it brought the human and economic implications of tropical cyclone changes into sharp focus.longer-term trends in tropical cyclone frequency, however, are uncertain3,4. most studies address just the past few decades because tropical cyclone records and other observational data are less reliable prior to the satellite era3,13,14,15 (since 1979). pre-satellite observations were made from restricted aerial or ship-based reconnaissance, and storms are missing from official records15. these data issues hinder delving back into the early twentieth century and pre-industrial decades, but reanalyses — globally consistent climate datasets created by combining observational data with a physical weather forecast model — offer a way forward12,16. to examine long-term trends, chand et al1. use twentieth-century reanalyses based on sea-level meteorological quantities that are relatively well observed over the past century. historical changes in the global observational network, which may introduce spurious trends, are therefore minimized. tropical cyclone data were extracted from one such reanalysis using objective detection algorithms, creating a proxy reconstruction of activity over time.chand et al1. find a global decrease in tropical cyclone frequency of around 13% over the twentieth century as compared with the pre-industrial (1850–1900) baseline. a steeper decline is seen after 1950, coinciding with recent accelerated warming. an exception is the north atlantic, where activity has declined since 1850 but increased since the 1960s. although questions remain about the reliability of pre-satellite (and certainly pre-1900) data, these results place the observed global decrease since 19902, which is dominated by north pacific trends, into a longer-term context. chand et al1. also find evidence for multiannual to decadal variability superimposed onto secular trends. the la niña–dominated climate state over recent decades has probably suppressed pacific and favoured atlantic tropical cyclone activity2. in the southern indian ocean, the influence of the pacific decadal oscillation, a long-lived, el niño–like pattern of pacific climate variability, on tropical cyclone numbers is apparent. in the north atlantic, the persistent warm (positive) phase of atlantic multidecadal variability, alongside reduced aerosol forcing, has contributed to the increase in this basin. overall, global downward trends remain robust after accounting for the effects of natural climate variability, but the regional details are important.is there a human fingerprint on falling tropical cyclone counts? chand et al1. address this question by examining two large ensembles of climate model experiments: historical simulations (including natural and anthropogenic climate forcing) are compared with pre-industrial control simulations (including only natural forcing). models simulate a decline in tropical cyclones when anthropogenic factors are included, consistent not only with their reconstruction but also a wealth of existing modelling studies4 (with a median decrease of 13% for a 2 °c increase in global mean surface temperature), although increases have also been projected17. although the models analysed do not reproduce the reconstructed decline in north indian ocean tropical cyclones, an example of where model biases obscure the drivers of regional climate trends, the global similarity of reconstructed and model-simulated declines is compelling. however, a key limitation of current, ‘high-resolution’ global climate models (and reanalyses) is that typical resolutions (around 0.5°) do not resolve the mesoscale processes that are important for tropical cyclone genesis and intensification. research with state-of-the-art, storm-resolving models (on the kilometre scale) is needed to explore how these processes influence global and regional trends and deepen our understanding.with these limitations in mind, chand et al1. attempt to explain the reconstructed decline by analysing the large-scale environmental factors that reanalyses and models are able to capture. three environmental quantities — vertical wind shear (which inhibits tropical cyclone development), mid-tropospheric mass flux (an indicator of deep convection) and saturation deficit (mid-tropospheric dryness) — were combined into a single measure of environmental favourability for tropical cyclones. this novel composite index shows a global decline since 1850, providing evidence that the tropospheric environment has become increasingly unfavourable for tropical cyclone formation. chand et al1. hypothesize that the observed weakening of the two major global atmospheric circulations, the walker and hadley circulations, is reducing tropical deep convection and mid-tropospheric humidity, with both reductions hostile to tropical cyclones.improvements in the ability of models to resolve cyclone processes across spatial scales will offer opportunities to test these ideas. also needed are studies comparing multiple indices of environmental change and efforts to estimate observational uncertainty in the pre-industrial decades and early twentieth century. in looking at the past century, chand et al1. raise questions about how well we understand complex tropical cyclone changes and how models may complement flawed observations. by continuing in this direction, we may advance our ability to attribute change to anthropogenic warming and refine projections for the next century.chand, s. s. et al. nat. clim. change
