nature has evolved several biosynthetic co2 fixation pathways for the conversion of co2 into multi-carbon molecules. now, a synthetic acetyl-coa bi-cycle is reported that offers increased carbon efficiency by rewiring carbon fixation and non-oxidative glycolysis with implications for industrial gas fermentation.since the industrial revolution, human activities have generated large amounts of greenhouse gases, of which the most prevalent is co2. in 2021, global emissions of co2 rose to 36 billion tonnes and today’s atmospheric co2 levels are higher than at any point in the past 800,000 years, leading to rapid climate change1. chemical manufacturing is a difficult to decarbonize sector because it is a carbon-intense industry and, unlike energy production, cannot be carbon-free. using co2 as a raw material for chemical synthesis is an important research direction allowing for carbon-negative manufacturing by either reusing carbon from co2-emitting processes, or by combining the manufacturing process with carbon capture2.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.protein images in dotted circles in panels a and b were created with biorender.com; panels c and d were reproduced from ref. 8, springer nature ltd.lüthi, d. et al. nature 453, 379–382 (2008).article google scholar scown, c. d. & keasling, j. d. nat. biotechnol. 40, 304–307 (2022).cas article google scholar preiner, m. et al. nat. ecol. evol. 4, 534–542 (2020).article google scholar russell, m. j. & martin, w. trends biochem. sci. 29, 358–363 (2004).cas article google scholar bar-even, a., noor, e. & milo, r. j. exp. bot. 63, 2325–2342 (2012).cas article google scholar claassens, n. j., cotton, c. a. r., kopljar, d. & bar-even, a. nat. catal. 2, 437–447 (2019).cas article google scholar takors, r. et al. microb. biotechnol. 11, 606–625 (2018).cas article google scholar wu, c. et al. nat. synth. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00095-4 (2022).article google scholar ragsdale, s. w. & pierce, e. biochim. biophys. acta 1784, 1873–1898 (2008).cas article google scholar fast, a. g., schmidt, e. d., jones, s. w. & tracy, b. p. curr. opin. biotechnol. 33, 60–72 (2015).cas article google scholar bogorad, i. w., lin, t.-s. & liao, j. c. nature 502, 693–697 (2013).cas article google scholar song, y. et al. proc. natl acad. sci. usa 117, 7516–7523 (2020).cas article google scholar download referencestwitter: michael köpkelanzatech inc, skokie, il, usamichael köpkeyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to michael köpke.m.k. is an employee of lanzatech, a for-profit company commercializing gas fermentation.reprints and permissionsköpke, m. redesigning co2 fixation. nat. synth 1, 584–585 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00131-3download citationpublished: 22 july 2022issue date: august 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00131-3anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
