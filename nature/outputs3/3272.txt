amino-containing four-carbon threose nucleic acids (tnas) have long been considered to be prebiotically irrelevant due to their difficult formation. now, a prebiotically plausible route to 3′-amino-tna nucleoside triphosphate has been developed, raising the possibility of 3′-amino-tna as a non-canonical nucleic acid during the origin of life.you have full access to this article via your institution.the ability of rna to perform dual roles of encoding genetic information and catalysing essential reactions in extant life lays the foundation for the rna world hypothesis, which suggests that rna was the first nucleic acid for the origin of life1. however, the prebiotic chemistry that gave rise to rna might have produced nucleic acid molecules with alternative sugar backbones in the structural neighbourhood2,3. motivated by exploring alternative nucleoside structures that can be formed under prebiotically plausible conditions, and investigating the question of why nature chose rna as the molecular basis of life’s genetic material, researchers pioneered by albert eschenmoser and colleagues have discovered non-canonical nucleotides, which might be possible genetic polymers at the origin of life4,5.among these nucleotides, the four-carbon threose nucleic acids (tnas), 2′-amino-tna, and 3′-amino-tna, are of particular interest due to their constitutionally simpler sugar structure, as well as their capability to self-hybridize and cross-talk with rna (and dna) through watson–crick base pairing6,7. completely oxygenous tna has been considered as a candidate nucleic acid preceding rna due to the simplicity both of its structure and of its formation8. by contrast, amino-tna nucleoside monomers have been considered prebiotically irrelevant by eschenmoser due to the complexity of their formation caused by huge chemical complications arising from nitrogenous compounds9. such compounds are normally involved in amadori and mannich-type chemistry, alongside aldol reactions, which generate nucleoside monomers under prebiotic conditions6,7. now, writing in nature chemistry, daniel whitaker and matthew powner have re-examined the possibility and simplicity of amino-tna formation by systematically demonstrating the facile synthesis of 3′-amino-tna nucleoside triphosphates starting from prebiotically plausible materials of two- and three- carbon units10.the powner laboratory has previously reported the diastereo- and regio- selective prebiotic synthesis of α-l-threocytidine — a component of tna — starting from glycolaldehyde 1 and 2-aminooxazole 2 (itself produced from glycolaldehyde 1, fig. 1a)8. however, the synthesis of amino-tna presents the additional difficulty of regioselective incorporation of an amino group into a tetrose sugar. here, by means of three-component coupling of glycolaldehyde 1, 2-aminooxazole 2 and a glycine nitrile 4 (or other aminonitriles) under slightly acidic conditions (ph 5), the formation of 3′-amino-aminooxazoline 5 was observed with both the 3′-amine and glycosidic bond regiospecifically positioned (fig. 1b). whitaker and powner found that the aminonitrile species acted as the ideal buffer as well as a coupling partner. when used in multiple equivalents, aminonitrile maintained a full buffering effect to drive the reaction to yields as high as 90%. further mixing of 3′-amino-aminooxazoline 5 with phosphate at neutral ph drove the phase separation of the threo- and erythro-isomer of 5. while erythro-5 was enriched in the supernatant, mainly in the form of unreactive by-product 6, threo-5 crystallized out in the form of phosphate salt (fig. 1c). significantly, phosphate was found to drive the co-precipitation, purification and concentration of the genetic threo-isomer, while also catalysing the conversion of the non-genetic erythro-isomer into an unreactive by-product.a, two-component coupling of glycolaldehyde 1 and 2-aminooxazole 2 led to the formation of threose aminooxazoline. b, three-component coupling of glycolaldehyde 1, 2-aminooxazole 2, and an aminonitrile 4 led to the formation of 3′-amino-aminooxazoline 5. c, at near neutral ph, phosphate drove the phase separation of 5, while erythro-5 was enriched in the supernatant in the form of an unreactive by-product 6, threo-5 crystallized out as phosphate salt. d, mixing cyanoacetylene 7 with threo-5 at ph 7 (or at ph 8.5 followed by lowering the buffer ph to 7 for accelerated reaction rate and yield) led to the formation of anhydronucleosides threo-8 and threo-9. e, threo-8 hydrolysed to threo-9 gradually at ph 7 (or rapidly at ph 2). f, site-specific thiolysis of threo-9 to 2-thio threo-10. g, photochemical anomerization of 1′-β-2-thio threo-10 gave rise to 1′-α-2-thio threo-11. h, phosphorylation of threo-11 by trimetaphosphate at ph 9 in the presence of mg2+ generated threo-12, 3′-amino-2-thio-threocytidine triphosphate. i, exposing threo-12 to sulfur-activating h2o2 led to the selective hydrolysis of the 2-sulfur group to form threo-13, the final product 3′-amino-threocytidine triphosphate.the nucleobase was subsequently constructed by reacting threo-5 with cyanoacetylene 7 in phosphate buffer at near neutral ph. competitive addition of 7 to threo-5 happened at both nucleophilic sites of the amino group, and led to the formation of anhydrocytidines threo-8 and threo-9 (fig. 1d). threo-8 gradually converted to threo-9 given the consumption of cyanoacetylene 7 in the reaction system, the speed of which can be accelerated by acid catalysis (fig. 1e). utilizing three prebiotically plausible two- and three-carbon units, whitaker and powner have successfully demonstrated that the core structure of 3′-amino-threo-nucleoside was regio- and diastereoselectively established in just two controllable steps with quite reasonable yields.the stereochemistry of the glycosidic bond formed between the nucleobase and the 1′-position of the tetrose sugar is considered critical for its polymer to form a stable duplex when base pairing with itself or another nucleic acid. the 1′-β stereoisomer is expected to form less stable duplexes than the corresponding 1’-α isomer. prior to the conversion of the resultant 1′-β conformation to 1′-α by anomerization, thiolysis of threo-9 in the presence of sodium hydrosulfide or hydrogen sulfide was performed. this reaction regioselectively positioned a sulfur atom at c2 on the nucleobase and generated threo-10, which is an efficient substrate for photochemical anomerization (fig. 1f). anomerization then took place smoothly by irradiating threo-10 at 254 nm in the presence of hydrogen sulfide, and gave rise to threo-11, the proto-genetic 1′-α isomer (fig. 1g). taking advantage of the relatively high nucleophilicity, the selective phosphorylation of the 3′-amino of threo-11 was performed using condensed phosphate species of trimetaphosphate in the presence of mgcl2 at ph 9. threo-12 was obtained in 60% yield in the form of 3′-amido-triphosphate within 5 days (fig. 1h). further reaction between threo-12 and sulfur-activating agent h2o2 at ph 9 hydrolysed the 2-sulfur group to generate threo-13, the final product 3′-amino-threocytidine triphosphate (fig. 1i).governed by the nucleophilicity of the 2′- or 3′- amino group, amino-tna polymers were previously demonstrated to be simpler to form than rna by non-enzymatic polymerization of activated phosphorimidazolide monomers11 and amenable to chemical coupling via phosphoramidite chemistry6. nucleoside triphosphates of any kind have not yet been reported for activity of non-enzymatic polymerization, which is considered the key transition to form functional and informational genetic polymers for the origin of life. nonetheless, the feasible regio- and stereoselective formation route to 3′-amino-tna nucleoside triphosphate by prebiotically plausible reactions demonstrated by the study from whitaker and powner suggests that 3′-amino-tna nucleoside triphosphate appears to be generationally simpler than that of rna as well. overall, the possible presence of 3′-amino-tna on the early earth as a potential progenitor of rna is experimentally implicated. in the future, studies regarding how to activate and drive the non-enzymatic polymerization of these tna amido-triphosphates, as well as other forms of nucleic acid monomers, are worthy of systematic investigation.gilbert, w. nature 319, 618 (1986).article google scholar kim, s. c., o’flaherty, d. k., giurgiu, c., zhou, l. & szostak,
