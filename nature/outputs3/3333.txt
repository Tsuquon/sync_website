by combining the link of a catenane with the interweaving of a trefoil knot, a molecular structure with a double knot-link containing 14 crossings is prepared. the knot-link contains two homochiral trefoil knots that are quadruply linked with each other.cui and jin designed the longer ligand (s,s)-l2 (fig. 2b) hoping that the extra space it afforded would expand the trefoil knot and encourage linking. the strategy worked; when it was reacted with 3, a linked compound was formed in 78% yield. the intricate structure contains two λ-trefoil knots that are quadruply interlocked with each other (fig. 1e,f). each knot contains three (s,s)-l2 and three 3 with 111 backbone atoms which, in turn, leads to 222 backbone atoms in the double knot-link ([c78n27rh6]2). the structure was characterized by several techniques, but most importantly the x-ray crystal structure confirmed the topology of the backbone in the solid state. the solution state of the structure was supported by a 1h–1h rotating-frame nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy nmr spectrum, which confirmed the expected close spatial proximity of the two trefoil knot components. mass spectrometry further established the structure, and fragmentation peaks showed, as expected, the mass for a single knot separated from its interlocked twin.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.wasserman, e. j. am. chem. soc. 82, 4433–4434 (1960).cas article google scholar gao, w. x., feng, h. j., guo, b. b., lu, y. & jin, g. x. chem. rev. 120, 6288–6325 (2020).cas article google scholar dietrich‐buchecker, c. o. & sauvage, j.-p. angew. chem. int. ed. 28, 189–192 (1989).article google scholar fielden, s. d., leigh, d. a. & woltering, s. l. angew. chem. int. ed. 56, 11166–11194 (2017).cas article google scholar cui, z. & jin, g.-x. nat. synth. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00094-5 (2022).article google scholar fenlon, e. e. eur. j. org. chem. 5023–5035 (2008).schaufelberger, f. commun. chem. 3, 182 (2020).cas article google scholar download referencesdepartment of chemistry, franklin and marshall college, lancaster, pa, usaedward e. fenlonyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to edward e. fenlon.the author declares no competing interests.reprints and permissionsfenlon, e.e. double, double trefoil and trouble. nat. synth 1, 586–587 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00103-7download citationpublished: 28 june 2022issue date: august 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00103-7anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
