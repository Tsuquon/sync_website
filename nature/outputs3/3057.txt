aberrant subcellular localization of proteins contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer. a study now reports that the mis-localization of mettl3, a nuclear n6-adenosine methyltransferase, to the cytoplasm promotes gastric cancer by enhancing mrna translation of a subset of oncogenes, independently of the n6-methyladenosine (m6a) modification.you have full access to this article via your institution.correct localization of proteins is required to properly guide cellular responses within tissues. in cancer, the location of proteins is often aberrantly regulated causing new protein–protein interactions and alternative subcellular functions. mettl3 is the key component of the m6a mrna methyltransferase complex regulating most aspects of mrna metabolism, including pre-mrna processing, nuclear export, decay and translation1. the m6a methyltransferase complex typically exhibits a nuclear localization, but mettl3 can also localize to the cytoplasm where it promotes translation in human cancer cells2,3 (fig. 1). however, the functional relevance of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic location of metll3 in cancer has remained elusive because upregulation of mettl3 can promote or repress tumour formation4.in the nucleus, mettl3 forms a complex with mettl14, wtap and other members of the m6a complex to co-transcriptionally write the modification on mrnas. deposition of m6a regulates stability, decay or translation of those target mrnas. in gastric cancer, changes in the subcellular distribution of mettl3 are observed, with the methyltransferase also being present in the cytoplasm where it enhances mrna translation independently of the m6a modification. in the cytoplasm, mettl3 interacts with pabpc1 to stabilize its binding with the eif4f complex and promote translation of a subset of mrnas to promote cancer progression (that is, setd1a, setd1b, mki67 and gata2).in this issue of nature cell biology, wei et al.5 report novel methylation-independent functions of mettl3 in the cytoplasm whereby mettl3 promotes stomach cancer via upregulation of mrna translation of specific transcripts. overexpression of mettl3 in gastric cancer correlated with poor prognosis of patients and suppression of mettl3 reduced patient-derived xenograft tumorigenicity in vivo. in most cancer studies, overexpression of mettl3 correlates with increased m6a levels and has pro-oncogenic roles4, and, as expected, the authors identified many mettl3-mediated m6a sites in human gastric cancer cell lines locating to 3′ untranslated regions (utrs) near stop codons. however, less than 5% of all mettl3-bound mrnas overlapped with m6a sites. binding of mettl3 to non-modified mrnas is probably not surprising given that mettl3 functions as a methyltransferase and m6a itself is detected by specific reader proteins. however, the substantial number of mrnas interacting with mettl3 in the 3′-untranslated region that did not carry m6a prompted the question of whether mettl3 displayed additional methylation-independent functions specific to gastric cancer.to probe for methylation-independent functions, the authors produced mettl3 enzymes with abolished m6a catalytic activity. overexpression of wild-type and enzymatically inactive versions of the protein both promoted tumour growth and metastasis. this observation raised the possibility that pro-oncogenic functions of mettl3 were not mediated by mrna methylation. interestingly, previous studies have shown that mettl3 mutant constructs with abrogated methylation activity can still directly interact and stabilize the tumour suppressor p53 (refs. 6,7). the human tp53 gene is the most frequently mutated tumour suppressor in cancer8. mutant p53 proteins lose their tumour-suppressive activities and gain additional pro-oncogenic functions. in line with these data, wei et al.5 found that non-methylated mettl3-bound mrnas were specifically enriched in tumorigenesis-related pathways including p53 signalling. this raises the interesting hypothesis that direct mettl3 interaction with wild-type p53 or mutated p53 may result in tumour suppression or promotion, respectively.mettl3 also promotes p53 activity in the nucleus by installing m6a on selected p53 target gene transcripts to ensure their potent expression7. however, mettl3 was primarily located in the cytoplasm in gastric cancer cells, in contrast to its nuclear localization in normal epithelial cells. other members of the m6a writer complex, such as mettl14 and wtap, were exclusively located in the nucleus. to further disentangle nuclear from cytoplasmic mettl3 functions, wei et al. mutated the nuclear localization sequence of mettl3 and found that only cytoplasmic mettl3 enhanced tumour cell proliferation. in the cytoplasm, mettl3 induced global activation of protein synthesis and enhanced translation efficiency of non-methylated mettl3-bound mrnas. to identify how mettl3 regulated mrna translation, the authors identified protein–protein interactors of cytoplasmic mettl3 by combining co-immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry. in addition to the expected translation initiation factors and ribosomal proteins2,3,9, other candidates were identified including pabpc1, a poly(a)-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and promotes ribosome recruitment and translation initiation10.pabpc1 promotes mrna translation by mediating circularization of mrnas through binding of the 3′ poly(a) tail and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4f (eif4f) complex at the 5′ cap of mrnas11,12. this loop formation promotes translation through ribosome recycling. similarly, it was previously reported that mettl3 also promotes mrna looping by binding eif3h and thereby enhances mrna translation of specific oncogenes2. however, wei et al.5 now propose that mettl3 can also directly bind pabpc1 in an rna-independent manner to stabilize the pabpc1–eif4f complex formation. the eif4f complex consists of the dead-box rna helicase eif4a, the cap-binding protein eif4e, and the large scaffold protein eif4g (ref. 12).to demonstrate complementary functions of mettl3 and pabpc1, wei et al.5 overexpressed pabpc1 in mettl3-deficient cells and rescued proliferation and survival defects in tumour cells. similar to suppression of mettl3, pabpc1 knockdown also reduced tumour growth in xenografts. commonly bound mrnas of pabpc1 and mettl3 were enriched in chromatin remodelling factors. the authors concluded that cytoplasmic mettl3 stabilizes the translation initiation complex to promote protein synthesis of oncogenes and multiple epigenetic factors.in patients with gastric cancer, pabpc1 expression correlated with mettl3 upregulation and poor prognosis. to test the prognostic value of cytoplasmic mettl3 for tumour progression and patient outcome, the authors quantified cytoplasmic to nuclear localization ratios in gastric and prostate cancer, two types of cancer for which mettl3 is predominantly cytoplasmic. a high ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear mettl3 signal significantly correlated with more severe clinical pathological characteristics, such as survival probability and clinical stage. by contrast, such a correlation was absent in oesophageal cancer, in which where mettl3 was overexpressed but predominantly located in the nucleus.in summary, wei et al.5 propose that upregulation of cytoplasmic but not nuclear mettl3 promotes tumorigenesis through its direct interaction with pabpc1 to boost mrna translation of a subset of oncogenes and chromatin remodellers. understanding how protein localization determines function is imperative for correct diagnosis and treatment of patients, and cytoplasmic mettl3 may be a novel prognostic marker for disease progression of gastric and prostate cancer. preventing the cytoplasmic accumulation of mettl3 in those patients may represent a novel therapeutic strategy.however, some questions remain unanswered. the cellular mechanism and trigger causing mettl3 to persist in the cytoplasm in cancer cells remain unknown. moreover, the physiological conditions that determine the exclusion of mettl3 from the nucleus are also unclear. potential stimuli may be cellular stressors such as dna damage, hypoxia and oncogenic signalling causing the activation of the tumour suppressor p53. the global change in p53-dependent transcriptional activity in response to dna damage may interrupt the nuclear m6a protein complex and allow mettl3 to form new protein–protein interactions with p53 in the nucleus or pabpc1 in the cytoplasm7.finally, this study highlights the challenges we face when studying the cellular importance of rna modifications. most rna-modifying proteins may have additional rna modification-independent functions. disentangling those functions will be instrumental to fully understand the scope of cell state-specific epitranscriptomes, which will resolve at least some discrepancy and controversy in the field.he, p. c. & he, c. embo j. 40, e105977 (2021).cas article google scholar choe, j. et al. nature 561, 556–560 (2018).cas article google scholar lin,
