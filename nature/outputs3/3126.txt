noble metal chalcogenides are rapidly becoming attractive materials in several areas of nanoscience; however, their synthesis remains challenging. now, a simple cation exchange protocol has been employed to prepare these materials in various phases and morphologies.nanostructures with different dimensionalities (for example, 0d, 1d and 2d) have emerged as potential building blocks for a variety of technologies directly impacting the fields of nano-optoelectronics, nano-magnetism, energy harvesting and storage, catalysis, light sensing and chemical sensing, as well as many others. from this perspective, it is essential to develop synthetic strategies that are compatible with a wide range of materials and structures. cation exchange (ce) is an attractive approach for post-synthetic chemical modification of materials. in ce, the cations of an ionic solid, used as a sacrificial template, are replaced with different chemical elements to form a new compound, while preserving the original morphology of the template. because ce is a low-temperature process, often controlled by the fast kinetics of the ion exchange, it allows the exploration of phases, compositions and morphologies that are not achievable by conventional high-temperature synthesis protocols, which are thermodynamically controlled1.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.rivest, j. b. & jain, p. k. chem. soc. rev. 42, 89–96 (2013).cas article google scholar feng, y. et al. nat. synth. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00117-1 (2022).article google scholar beberwyck, b. j., surendranath, y. & alivisatos, a. p. j. phys. chem. c 117, 19759–19770 (2013).cas article google scholar pi, l. et al. adv. funct. mater. 29, 1904932 (2019).cas article google scholar download referencesdepartment of physics, university of south florida, tampa, florida, usahumberto rodríguez gutiérrezyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to humberto rodríguez gutiérrez.the author declares no competing interests.reprints and permissionsgutiérrez, h.r. ennobling chalcogenides. nat. synth 1, 582–583 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00118-0download citationpublished: 25 july 2022issue date: august 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00118-0anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
