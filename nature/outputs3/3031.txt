making chiral molecules by c–h bond activation using inexpensive, earth-abundant metal catalysts is challenging. now, a cobalt salt combined with a salicyl-oxazoline ligand enables a c–h activation and annulation process and the introduction of axial chirality around a c–n bond.synthetic chemists are fascinated with creating molecules with various forms of stereoisomerism beyond point chirality at a tetrahedral carbon centre. among the various strategies for enantioselective synthesis, activation and functionalization of c–h bonds is particularly attractive in terms of atom- and step-economy. indeed, the past decade has witnessed a rapidly growing number of enantioselective c–h functionalizations mediated by chiral transition metal catalysts. nonetheless, most of the catalysts comprise precious metals such as palladium, rhodium, and iridium1, which is not ideal from a sustainability point of view.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.newton, c. g., wang, s. g., oliveira, c. c. & cramer, n. chem. rev. 117, 8908–8976 (2017).cas article google scholar loup, j., dhawa, u., pesciaioli, f., wencel-delord, j. & ackermann, l. angew. chem. int. ed. 58, 12803–12818 (2019).cas article google scholar si, x.-j. et al. nat. synth. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00114-4 (2022).article google scholar rodriguez-salamanca, p., fernandez, r., hornillos, v. & lassaletta, j. m. chem. eur. j. 28, e202104442 (2022).cas pubmed google scholar grigorjeva, l. & daugulis, o. angew. chem. int. ed. 53, 10209–10212 (2014).cas article google scholar yao, q.-j., chen, j.-h., song, h., huang, f.-r. & shi, b.-f. angew. chem. int. ed. 61, e202202892 (2022).cas google scholar daugulis, o., roane, j. & tran, l. d. acc. chem. res. 48, 1053–1064 (2015).cas article google scholar download referencestwitter: @ny_1978graduate school of pharmaceutical sciences, tohoku university, sendai, japanjun kikuchi & naohiko yoshikaiyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to naohiko yoshikai.the authors declare no competing interests.reprints and permissionskikuchi, j., yoshikai, n. cobalt selectively annulates. nat. synth (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00126-0download citationpublished: 08 august 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00126-0anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
