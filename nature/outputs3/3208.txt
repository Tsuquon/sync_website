distribution data from the north american breeding bird survey shows an increasing mismatch between species distribution and climate.you have full access to this article via your institution.alongside habitat loss, climate change represents one of the biggest threats facing biodiversity1. many species respond by shifting their distributions in order to stay in their preferred climatic conditions2. however, even species that do shift their distributions still face challenges that can prevent them from tracking their optimal climatic conditions successfully. species might not be mobile enough to keep pace with climate change or there might be physical barriers, such as unsuitable habitat, that could hinder dispersal3. habitat loss may further confound this by leading to reductions in areas that are suitable for species in terms of both habitat and climate, making it increasingly difficult for species to satisfy both requirements4. however, while scientists have observed that many species are shifting their ranges, it is less clear whether these shifts allow species to match their preferred climatic conditions — and what this might mean for long-term population trends.writing in nature ecology and evolution, viana and chase5 make use of long-term data on population occupancy and on abundance of common north american breeding birds to measure trends in climate matching between 1989 and 2018, and to identify how this relates to population trajectories. climate matching is defined by the authors as the predictive strength of climate on species occupancy and abundance. over the last 30 years, the authors find an overall trend of climatic decoupling, with climate becoming a less-important predictor of species distribution through time. their finding that species on average decouple from climate is concerning, particularly when paired with the observation that bird species with declining occupancy and abundance were especially decoupled with climate through time. however, it is not possible to tell whether climate decoupling is driving the decline in species’ populations or vice-versa.this headline result hides a lot of interesting nuance. despite the overall decoupling trend, the authors find a lot of variation among the 114 species they surveyed from across north america in the breeding bird survey6. environmental factors and/or species traits might explain why species are responding differently to environmental change7. for example, in regions where habitat or climate change is particularly fast or dramatic, species might be less able to track climate than where the changes are gradual8,9. generalist species, which are adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, might also be better able to match both climate and habitat preferences10. previous studies in birds and other taxa have linked variation in body size and in movement ability to the ability to maintain climatic conditions. it is thought to be more energetically costly for larger animals to move11, but larger organisms might be better able to tolerate changes in climate12. therefore, large birds might be expected to become more decoupled from climate than smaller birds. finally, birds which have better dispersal ability might be better able to track climate, particularly in increasingly fragmented habitats13.the authors tested whether the environment and/or species traits might be driving the differences in climate coupling trends observed across their sample, which includes songbirds, woodpeckers, pigeons, doves and hawks. surprisingly, the rate of environmental change was not related to the trends in climate matching. the authors suggest that species traits may therefore be more important than environment predictors in driving this variation. alternatively, it might be that the rates of environmental change that occurred in the study region did not surpass species coping abilities. of the species traits investigated, habitat specialization was most important: habitat specialists were less able to match climate conditions. the grasshopper sparrow, a grassland specialist, showed the largest decoupling with climate, as well as the largest population declines. consistent with previous studies, smaller birds were more likely to become decoupled from climate14. one of the most surprising results was that there was no relationship between dispersal ability and trends in climate matching. together these findings provide some indication that small, specialist species might be more vulnerable to climate change15.interestingly, climate decoupling was not always associated with population declines. several increasingly decoupled species are increasing in abundance and/or occupancy. the authors suggest that this could be the result of increases in suitable habitat, of adaptation or perhaps of a previously unrecognized tolerance to a wide range of conditions. for example, population increases in cliff swallows may be the result of increased nest site availability from human-built bridges (fig. 1). this highlights a key limitation, which the authors recognize, of linking climate with distribution data: it is impossible to know whether species are occupying the full range of climatic conditions they can tolerate (namely the fundamental niche)16. as a large proportion of the species studied are migrants that occupy very different locations in each part of the year, it is possible that they are able to tolerate a wider range of conditions than is reflected in the breeding distribution17. study of the non-breeding range of species, as well as physiological tolerance data from experiments, will be key to disentangling this.robert clay / alamy stock photo.however, for cliff swallows, populations were found to be increasing, possibly due to increases in human made nest site opportunities.viana and chase provide a good framework to try to understand how species will cope with climate change in ever-fragmented landscapes. however, applying this framework to other species groups and regions will be challenging, given the lack of large-scale, long-term monitoring data for most species18. although birds are particularly well studied by standardised programmes such as the breeding bird survey used here6, only a few dozen species had sufficient data availability even for this well-studied group. the non-breeding range of migratory species is particularly poorly recorded. as 85% of the species included in the study are migratory, population trends observed in the breeding range may be driven by processes occurring in the non-breeding range19,20. looking forward, combining multiple sources of data (for example, citizen science and structured surveys)20 may allow an increase in the spatial, temporal and taxonomic extent of such studies and may help to uncover more general patterns.brondizio, e. s., settele, j., díaz, s. & ngo, h. t. global assessment
