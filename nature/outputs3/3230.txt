primary cilia transduce cues, including hedgehog (hh) signals, and possess doublet microtubules that interact with kinesin motors. the kinesin kif7 is important for hh signalling and binds to gli transcription factors. haque et al. reveal that, surprisingly, gli proteins bind a dna-like part of kif7 to promote their accumulation at the ciliary tip.you have full access to this article via your institution.hedgehog (hh) signalling patterns tissues such as the neural tube and limb buds during development, and when mis-activated causes cancers such as medulloblastoma. similar to photons and odorants, vertebrate hh signals are transduced via cilia, microtubule-based organelles possessed by most cells1. in this issue, haque et al.2 reveal how a kinesin mimics dna to bind a transcription factor effector of the hh signalling pathway at the tips of cilia.turning hh signalling on and off is intimately related to changing the protein composition of the cilium: upon binding the hh ligand, its receptor, patched1 (ptch1), exits the cilium. consequently, a central effector of the pathway, smoothened (smo), enters the cilium (fig. 1). these changes are interpreted by gli proteins, unusual transcription factors that concentrate at the ciliary tip1. gli proteins also visit the nucleus to regulate hh target genes in a way that depends on what they witnessed in the cilium1.a, in the absence of hh ligands, patched1 (ptch1) at the primary cilium prevents the entry of smoothened (smo). if gli levels are substoichiometric, the coiled coil of kif7 antagonizes its own binding to microtubules and kif7 levels at the ciliary tip are low. gli is processed into its repressor form (gli-r) and hh target gene expression is kept off. b, in the presence of hh, ptch1 exits the cilium and smo enters. through an unknown mechanism, ciliary smo promotes the recruitment of kif7–gli complexes to the ciliary tip. gli binds a dna-like domain of kif7 via its zinc-fingers, which augments kif7 binding to microtubules. gli-mediated stabilization of ciliary kif7 could potentiate hh signalling by enhancing ciliary gli accumulation. gli is activated (gli-a), moves to the nucleus and induces target genes.gli proteins possess five zinc-fingers, four of which bind a consensus dna motif3. while gli1 is a dedicated transcriptional activator, gli2 and gli3 contain both transcriptional activator and repressor domains. the balance of gli2 and gli3 activator and repressor activities dictates hh pathway output3.although gli proteins are the only transcription factors known to visit the ciliary tip (a locale that is almost as distant from the nucleus as possible while still in the same cell), other transcription factors can be regulated by tethering to other subcellular locales. for example, srebp2 is held in the endoplasmic reticulum by its transmembrane domains until sterol levels become limited4. other transcription factors can be restrained by binding to microtubules5,6.the gli proteins share the ciliary tip, the cell’s penthouse, with a select group of roommates that include the kinesin kif77. when cells encounter hh ligands, kif7 and gli proteins accumulate at ciliary tips (fig. 1). localization of gli2 within the cilium is necessary for it to become a transcriptional activator8, and kif7 is essential for hh pathway regulation in mice and zebrafish9,10. similarly, in humans, mutations in kif7 cause ciliopathies (for example, joubert syndrome) associated with defective hh signalling11,12.previous studies have suggested that kif7 defines the ciliary tip compartment, as loss of kif7 dysregulates ciliary microtubules and disrupts gli2 ciliary localization7. thus, we assumed that kif7 was a passive landing platform at the ciliary tip that would simply tether gli proteins via a canonical c-terminal cargo-binding domain.however, in this issue of nature cell biology, haque et al. reveal that kif7 is a more interesting, dynamic participant in gli function2. the authors used in vitro pull-down assays and found that kif7 and gli2 interact directly with each other and that gli2 uses its zinc-fingers (fingers 2 and 3, specifically) to bind kif7. surprisingly, the authors found that kif7 binds gli2, not through the kif7 domain canonically used for cargo binding, but principally via its coiled-coil dimerization domain. thus, gli2 re-uses its dna-binding domain to interact with a ciliary kinesin, and, unusually for a kinesin, kif7 uses a dimerization domain to bind a transcription factor.further compelling biochemical analyses by the authors revealed that one kif7 coiled-coil dimer binds one gli2. how might this unanticipated interaction work? by modelling the structure of two kif7 coiled coils, haque et al.2 found that its shape and charge distribution are similar to those of double-stranded dna, suggesting that the kif7 coiled-coil dimer is a dna mimic that binds gli2 in the cilium in a way parallel to dna binding of dna in the nucleus. in support of this possibility, gli2-binding dna competes with the kif7 coiled coil for gli2 binding in vitro. furthermore, mutagenesis performed by the authors helped reveal that dna-like electrostatic interactions between gli2 and kif7 promote binding. thus, kif7 joins a select group of proteins that mimic dna to bind transcription factors13,14.in addition to the main interaction with the kif7 coiled coil, haque et al.2 identified a second, weaker mode of gli2 binding to kif7 via its dimeric motor domain, perhaps enhanced by the interaction of kif7 with microtubules. with cryo-electron microscopy, the authors found evidence for how gli2 binds to the motor domain on microtubules. interestingly, total internal reflection fluorescence (tirf) microscopy showed that a dimeric form of kif7 binds microtubules five-fold more strongly in the presence of the gli2 zinc-fingers.many kinesins, including kif7, are autoinhibited when not bound to cargo. the authors performed domain swapping and point mutation experiments, which indicated that the kif7 coiled coil inhibits the association of the motor domain association with microtubules. together, these data suggest that gli2 is not just an interactor, but also a potentiator of kif7’s affinity for microtubules.one model to explain the available data is that gli2 binding to the kif7 coiled coil relieves its inhibition of the motor domain’s binding of microtubules. presumably this gli2-mediated relief of autoinhibition represents an allosteric effect between the coiled-coil and motor domains, two regions that are, at least in the elongated state, distant from each other.another implication of gli2’s potentiation of kif7 microtubule binding is that gli2 may promote its own tethering to microtubules. in support of this possibility, haque et al.2 found that kif7 localization to the ciliary tip is dependent on gli proteins. another gli interactor, sufu, also depends on kif7 and gli proteins for ciliary localization7,15. thus, gli proteins might be a key nucleating factor defining the ciliary tip compartment. still unclear are how this complex localizes to the tip and not along the axoneme, whether the canonical cargo-binding domain of kif7 is interacting with other proteins, and whether gli2 promotes kif7 binding to doublet microtubules.the hh signalling pathway incorporates multiple positive and negative forms of transcriptional feedback. gli proteins promoting their own ciliary localization via augmenting kif7’s microtubule binding may be a form of post-transcriptional positive feedback and may explain the long-observed phenomenon that hh signals increase the amount of gli proteins at the ciliary tip.homologues of kif7, gli and sufu exist in drosophila, which do not use cilia for hh signalling, as well as sponges. sponges and the bilaterian lineage in which we and drosophila reside are likely to exist in different evolutionary lineages. therefore, if the sponge homologues of kif7, gli and sufu form a complex that functions at cilia, it is likely that this complex has had ciliary functions since near the dawn of animals (but may have evolved to have non-ciliary functions).gli proteins are subject to extensive post-translational modifications, including proteolysis and phosphorylation3. as these modifications are not known to affect zinc-fingers 2 and 3, we would predict that they would not affect gli binding to kif7. however, it will be interesting to determine whether hh signalling regulates the gli interaction with kif7, perhaps by regulating kif7 post-translational modifications that affect its conformation or affinity for microtubules. as we have disappointingly limited understanding of how ciliary smo communicates to gli proteins, more light shed on kif7 may answer long-standing questions about hh signal transduction.bangs, f. & anderson, k. v. cold spring harb. perspect. biol. 9, a028175
