the concentrations of two key blood biomarkers for alzheimer’s disease are affected by some medical conditions, which could potentially lead to misdiagnosis.you have full access to this article via your institution.alzheimer’s disease (ad) is the most frequent cause of dementia in older individuals and is defined not by the clinical symptoms but by the presence of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain. cerebrospinal fluid (csf) biomarkers and amyloid positron emission tomography (pet) tests can accurately detect ad brain pathology, but the perceived risks, costs, and lack of availability of these tests have contributed to a low rate of ad biomarker testing in the clinic.the recent development of blood biomarkers for ad may enable much broader clinical testing of patients with cognitive concerns1. however, ad blood tests have been studied almost exclusively in research cohorts consisting of very healthy, well-educated, non-hispanic white individuals and it has been unclear whether they would perform similarly in clinical populations, which are diverse and have a much higher rate of medical conditions. in this issue of nature medicine, mielke et al.2 evaluate the performance of key blood biomarkers of ad in a large, community-based cohort. importantly, they found that multiple medical conditions affected the performance of these tests.amyloid plaques start to accumulate more than a decade before the onset of cognitive decline, and blood tests can detect ad brain pathology even in individuals who are cognitively unimpaired. a low ratio of plasma amyloid-β peptides aβ42 to aβ40 may reflect decreased clearance of aβ42 from the brain and/or the sequestration of aβ42 into amyloid plaques, while increased concentrations of plasma tau phosphorylated at position 181 (p-tau181) or 217 (p-tau217) may reflect a response to amyloid plaques1. plasma p-tau217 is an especially promising ad biomarker that distinguishes ad from non-ad causes of dementia, has high concordance with both amyloid pet and tau pet status, predicts cognitive status and cognitive decline, and is correlated with tau tangle burden on autopsy3,4,5,6. plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 are already being used in ad clinical trials to screen individuals for ad and to monitor the effects of ad treatments. however, previous work by the mielke group demonstrated that plasma levels of aβ42, aβ40, total tau, and neurofilament light were associated with some medical conditions7, prompting the question of whether plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 levels are also affected in this way.in the current study, mielke et al.2 examined the relationship of plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 concentrations with medical conditions in 1,329 participants enrolled in the population-based mayo clinic study of aging. most participants were older and cognitively unimpaired. as expected, higher levels of p-tau181 and p-tau217 were associated with cognitive impairment and a positive amyloid and/or tau pet scan. however, the study also found higher plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 concentrations in individuals with chronic kidney disease (ckd), hypertension, stroke, and myocardial infarction. the magnitude of differences in plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 associated with these conditions, especially ckd, were very significant, and in some cases larger than differences seen between amyloid-pet-positive and amyloid-pet-negative groups. in addition, plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 concentrations were found to be associated with body mass index, years of education, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and cancer, but these associations were not significant after adjustment for age and sex. overall, these findings demonstrate that while plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 are accurate ad biomarkers in most individuals, certain comorbidities could lead to a misdiagnosis of ad (fig. 1). plasma concentrations of p-tau181 and p-tau217 are affected by alzheimer’s disease brain pathology and medical comorbidities.it is possible that other plasma biomarker measures may perform more consistently than plasma p-tau181 or p-tau217 concentrations. for example, previous work by the same group found higher concentrations of both aβ42 and aβ40 associated with ckd, and while aβ42/aβ40 was also higher with ckd, it was affected to a lesser degree7. the kidneys have a major role in clearing proteins from the blood, so it is plausible that ckd could directly result in higher concentrations of aβ42 and aβ40. if the increase in aβ42 and aβ40 associated with ckd is relatively proportionate, this might explain why the ratio of aβ42 to aβ40 is less affected. since concentrations of most plasma biomarkers seem to be affected by ckd, alternative plasma biomarker measures — such as the percentage of tau that is phosphorylated at position 217 (ref. 8) — might perform more consistently. additionally, measures that can differentiate between brain-derived and peripheral sources of blood biomarkers may be helpful in reducing the background noise in these tests9. further research is needed to determine which plasma biomarker measures perform consistently in clinical populations.in clinical practice, ad biomarker tests (including csf biomarkers and amyloid pet) have typically used a single cut-off to dichotomize individuals as either biomarker-positive or biomarker-negative. however, if plasma biomarker levels vary predictably as a function of measurable factors, models can be constructed to predict ad brain pathology more accurately. such models are used in other fields of medicine; an example is the cockcroft–gault equation to estimate renal clearance based on serum creatinine concentration, sex, age, weight, and height10.one important limitation of the study by mielke et al.2 is that 97% of the cohort was white, and some medical conditions are more common in people from under-represented groups11. a recent study found that plasma aβ42/aβ40 performed consistently in models predicting ad brain pathology in both african american and white individuals, whereas plasma p-tau181, p-tau231, and neurofilament light concentrations performed inconsistently12. while including race as a factor in models may exacerbate health disparities, adjusting for the effects of comorbidities that tend to vary by race and socioeconomic status (such as ckd) could reduce the disproportionate misdiagnosis of ad that might otherwise occur.the work by mielke et al.2 prompts concern that using concentrations of single plasma analytes to identify individuals with ad could lead to the misdiagnosis of individuals with certain comorbidities. identification of plasma biomarker measures that perform consistently in clinical populations, and the use of models that can adjust for the effects of comorbidities or other related factors, may improve the accuracy of ad blood tests. furthermore, these findings underscore the need to evaluate ad blood tests in large cohorts that are representative of the patient population in which the test is to be used.in the version of this article initially published, there was a typo in the last sentence of the third-to-last paragraph, where in the text now reading an example is the cockcroft–gault equation to estimate renal clearance based on serum creatinine concentration, sex, age, weight, and height, creatinine originally read creatine. the change has been made in the html and pdf versions of the article.teunissen, c. e. et al. lancet neurol. 21, 66–77 (2021).article google scholar mielke, m. m. et al. nat. med.
