though her2 (erbb2) exon 20 insertion mutations occur in ~2% of non-small-cell lung cancers, molecular targeted therapies for such cancers have been lacking. a study now identifies selective her2 inhibitors that have marked efficacy against tumors driven by her2 exon 20 insertions, without inhibiting wild-type egfr activity.you have full access to this article via your institution.human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by erbb2, for which no ligand has been identified and which acts as a dimerization partner for other erbb members. following receptor dimerization, intracellular tyrosine kinase domains are activated and elicit mitogenic signaling1. genetic alterations of her2 occur frequently in cancer and can be categorized into two groups: (i) gene-amplification-mediated overactivation, which is relatively common in breast2 and colorectal cancers3, and (ii) activating mutations mostly affecting the kinase region of her2, which are observed mainly in non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc)4. for the treatment of her2-expressing breast cancer (including those with erbb2 amplification), trastuzumab, an anti-her2 antibody, has been used clinically as a monotherapy or in combination with anticancer agents5. by contrast, activating mutations of her2 (mostly erbb2 exon 20 insertions, such as her2yvma) are found in ~2% of nsclcs; are more frequent among women, nonsmokers and younger patients; and — unlike in breast and colorectal cancers — are insensitive to her2-inhibitory antibodies such as trastuzumab.the high homology between her2 and other erbb family members, including egfr, provides some cross-targeting efficacy of existing egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) against other members of this receptor family, but also makes it more challenging to specifically target mutant her2 while sparing other tyrosine kinases, such as wild-type egfr (fig. 1). for instance, second-generation tkis developed for egfr-activating mutations in nsclc, such as afatinib and neratinib, can also inhibit her2 at very low concentrations, leading to clinical trials in patients with her2-mutation-positive lung cancer that unfortunately did not result in sufficient clinical benefit6,7,8. next-generation egfr inhibitors such as poziotinib and mobocertinib are active against exon 20 insertion mutants of egfr and also have high inhibitory activity against her2 insertion mutants, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50) values in the nanomolar range, and poziotinib is currently undergoing a phase 2 clinical trial in nsclc9. in this issue of nature cancer, neumüller and colleagues aim to address the unmet clinical need to target her2-insertion-mutant nsclc by developing tkis that are selective for her2, including exon 20 mutants, while sparing wild-type egfr10.a, overlaid egfr and her2 kinase domain structure obtained using the reported crystal structure data (egfr: pdb id 2ity; her2: pdb id 3pp0). positions affected by exon 20 insertions are shown in a different color. b, amino acid sequence of her2 and part of the portion of egfr encoded by egfr exon 20. a common her2 exon 20 insertion mutation is shown below. c, her2-mutation- or her2-amplification-mediated growth signaling in cancer cells.the authors first screened more than 70 existing tkis across a panel of egfr- and her2-mutant cell lines, highlighting the lack of a compound that specifically inhibits her2yvam but not wild-type egfr. to develop such a compound, they next profiled more than 10,000 compounds for their selectivity between her2 and egfr phosphorylation. the authors integrated these data with structural information for wild-type her2 and identified serine 783 as a key amino acid determining compound selectivity for her2 variants harboring exon 20 mutation, including yvma, over egfr, permitting them to focus on a final set of four compounds. among these compounds, two inhibitors potently inhibited her2 at single-digit nanomolar concentrations, but were active against wild-type egfr at concentrations of over several hundred nanomolar. furthermore, even at micromolar concentrations, the two compounds were highly selective for her2, inhibiting just four and five, respectively, of 397 kinases tested, three of which were her2, her4 and egfr. mechanistically, these compounds inhibited her2 by covalently binding to cysteine 805, which corresponds to the egfr cysteine 797 residue that is covalently bound by the egfr inhibitors osimertinib, afatinib and dacomitinib. neumüller and colleagues engineered her2 point mutations to show that residue 783, which is a serine rather than the cysteine occupying the equivalent position in egfr, defined the selectivity of these compounds for her2, despite the high homology between the her2 and egfr kinase domains. the authors went on to study putative resistance mechanisms to the two compounds in vitro and observed that a her2 c805s substitution significantly reduced inhibitory activity.to evaluate the potency of their lead compounds, bi-1622 and bi-4142, in a functional setting, the authors established a panel of cancer cell lines harboring her2 or egfr exon 20 mutations. notably, they observed a dose-dependent decrease in the phosphorylated, activated forms of her2 and its downstream effector kinase, erk, following treatment with either lead compound, demonstrating that her2yvma maintains oncogenic signaling through the mapk pathway. bi-1622 and bi-4142 also showed high antitumor efficacy in vivo in xenograft mouse tumor models with engineered h2170 and pc9 cells and had a favorable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics profile. these driver-oncogene swapped cells could be very useful for studying rare-driver-oncogene-positive tumors, especially when a cell line positive for the rare driver oncogene is unavailable.importantly, the authors showed that their selective her2 inhibitors outperformed pan-erbb inhibitors in vitro and in vivo in efficacy and tolerability. they confirmed these findings were also consitent in a her2-overexpressing gastric tumor model, as well as a patient-derived her2yvma xenograft, in which inhibition of oncogenic signaling was also observed in vivo. lastly, the authors sought to identify genetic determinants of cellular response or resistance to their selective her2 inhibitor by performing a genome-wide crispr gene–drug interaction screen. these experiments showed that the inhibition of the dph1 and dph2 factors of the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway resulted in a growth advantage in cells challenged with her2 inhibition. conversely, results of igf1r or yap1 depletion implicated the insulin and hippo pathways, respectively, as decreasing sensitivity to her2 inhibitors.in summary, neumüller and colleagues10 have developed a potentially potent therapeutic approach for her2-mutant nsclc. although the safety and efficacy of these drugs in human patients will need to be examined in clinical trials, the hope is that they will fill an unmet clinical gap in this space. as noted above, trastuzumab and pertuzumab, both her2 antibodies that target the extracellular domain of her2, show antitumor activity in breast cancer, but not in her2-mutant nsclc, with pan-erbb inhibitors (such as afatinib, poziotinib and pyrotinib) also showing limited efficacy. nevertheless, this is a very active area of preclinical and clinical work. for instance, several antibody–drug conjugates of anti-her2 antibodies (such as trastuzumab) conjugated with cytotoxic drugs (such as topoisomerase or microtubule inhibitors) have shown high efficacy in clinical trials for her2-positive breast, gastric and lung cancers with her2-activating mutations11. on the basis of the results of clinical trials, t-dm1, trastuzumab-emtansine, was approved to treat her2-positive breast cancer12. by contrast, t-dxd, trastuzumab-deruxtecan, was approved to treat her2-positive breast and gastric cancers, with clinical trials showing efficacy in patients with metastatic her2-mutant nsclc13,14,15; however, although t-dxd is highly anticipated as the first effective therapy for such tumors to reach the clinic, ~50% of patients treated had grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, with interstitial lung disease occurring in 25% of the cases. thus, the advent of additional agents specifically targeting her2-mutant cancers is a welcome development, especially for lung cancer driven by her2-activating mutations, for which drug development has lagged behind. although achieving a cure remains challenging, the development of multiple treatment strategies for her2-mutant nsclc, similar to those for egfr-mutant lung cancer or alk-rearranged nsclc, is crucial. further investigations of the mechanisms of acquired and primary resistance to such therapies are also essential to identify specific and efficacious drugs or therapeutic combinations.by delivering on these aims through preclinical drug development and exploration of drug resistance, the study by neumüller and colleagues10 holds the potential to pave the way for the clinical testing of new treatments for of her2-mutant nsclc.moasser, m. m. oncogene 26, 6469–6487 (2007).cas article google scholar owens, m. a., horten, b. c. & da silva, m. m. clin. breast cancer 5,
