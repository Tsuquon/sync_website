adding a promoter to a catalytic reaction can dramatically alter the performance and reactivity of a chemical transformation. by incorporating a brønsted acid promoter to a photocatalysed reaction, previously unreactive c–h bonds can be functionalized, enabling the discovery of drug molecules.one of the most influential catalytic reactions developed is the haber–bosch process for synthesizing ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen using an iron catalyst. indeed, what makes the haber–bosch process so powerful is the incorporation of molybdenum as a promoter, a substance added to a catalyst to improve its performance1. this addition results in a robust and efficient process that is performed on metric ton scales — driving a surge in global crop production and, ultimately, the human population2. the use of promoters in catalysis is also prevalent for other industrial reactions; however, as the complexity of the substrates go beyond diatomic gases, achieving the desired reactivity is challenging.your institute does not have access to this articlesubscribe to journalget full journal access for 1 year111,21 €only 9,27 € per issueall prices are net prices. vat will be added later in the checkout.tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.buy articleget time limited or full article access on readcube.$32.00all prices are net prices.hutchings, g. j. catal. lett. 75, 1–12 (2001).cas article google scholar smil, v. nature 400, 415 (1999).cas article google scholar cao, h. et al. nat. synth. https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00125-1 (2022).article google scholar nam, w., lee, y.-m. & fukuzumi, s. acc. chem. res. 51, 2014–2022 (2018).cas article google scholar sacramento, j. j. d. & goldberg, d. p. acc. chem. res. 51, 2641–2652 (2018).cas article google scholar chen, j. et al. chem. sci. 6, 3624–3632 (2015).cas article google scholar schultz, d. & campeau, l.-c. nat. chem. 12, 661–664 (2020).article google scholar download referencestwitter: @danithechemistprocess research and development, mrl, merck & co., inc., kenilworth, nj, usadiane n. le & danielle m. schultzyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholaryou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarcorrespondence to diane n. le or danielle m. schultz.the authors declare no competing interests.reprints and permissionsle, d.n., schultz, d.m. promoting photocatalysts to a new role. nat. synth (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00156-8download citationpublished: 15 august 2022doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-022-00156-8anyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:sorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article. provided by the springer nature sharedit content-sharing initiative
