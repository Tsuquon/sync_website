 tiling patterns can be found thoughout the natural world - from honeycomb to fish scales. but now researchers have come up with a new way to create patterns in petri dishes - using bacteria. by engineering bacterial cells to express uniquely adhesive proteins on their surface, the team could create linear patterns - formed as colonies of cells stuck together when they grew. what's more, by varying the exact proteins expressed and modelling where to place the bacterial cells , they were able to control the resulting geometry - creating a range of complex patternsresearch paper: 4-bit adhesion logic enables universal multicellular interface patterningfor more stories like these sign up for the nature briefing: an essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, free in your inbox every weekday.
