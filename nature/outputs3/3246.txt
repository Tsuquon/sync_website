in airway epithelial cells, exposure to allergen proteases induces the stress granules-mediated transfer of il-33 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and extracellular release through gasdermin d pores containing a newly described active fragment.you have full access to this article via your institution.the cytokine interleukin-33 (il-33), from the il-1 family, potently induces type 2 immunity and mucosal inflammation1, and a large-scale genome-wide association study has implicated both il-33 and its receptor il1rl1 (also known as st2) in asthma susceptibility2. although il-33 is constitutively expressed and stored within the nucleus1, little is known about how it is mobilized and released extracellularly. in this issue of nature immunology, chen et al.3 report that exposure of airway epithelial cells to allergen proteases promotes the assembly of stress granules that carry il-33 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed by extracellular release of il-33 through membrane pores consisting of a novel gasdermin d (gsdmd) fragment (fig. 1).il-33 is constitutively produced and localized within the nucleus through its nuclear localization domain. when exposed to allergen proteases, gsdmd is cleaved to a 40-kda (mouse) or 35-kda (human) n-terminal fragment by as yet unknown protease(s); the figure depicts the mouse 40-kda fragment. these fragments assemble into membrane pores that transport il-33 from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space. exposure to allergen protease also promotes the assembly of stress granules that carry il-33 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, making it available for extracellular release through the gsdmd pores. when exposed to microbial products and other pattern-recognition receptor (prr) ligands, inflammasome-activated caspase 1 cleaves gsdmd to a canonical 35-kda n-terminal fragment (mouse). concomitantly, pro-il-1β is produced and processed to mature il-1β by caspase 1. the canonical n-terminal gsdmd fragment assembles into membrane pores that transport mature il-1β to the extracellular space and allow the influx of water and ions, resulting in pyroptosis of cells.the airway epithelium provides a physical barrier to the atmospheric environment and thus constitutes a key component of the mucosal immune system. indeed, airway epithelial cells produce a range of mediators that promote and regulate the immune response, such as — but not limited to — il-33, il-25 and tsl4. il-33 activates group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ilc2s), th2 cells, mast cells, eosinophils and other immune cells, and the importance of il-33 in type 2 airway inflammation and tissue remodeling has been well established1. however, major questions remain regarding the mechanisms involved in il-33 production and secretion.il-33 is unique among the il-1 cytokine family. in the steady state, il-33 is abundantly and constitutively expressed by structural cells, such as epithelial cells, and stored in the nuclei of these cells via the chromatin binding motif in the nuclear domain1. nuclear localization has a critical role in regulating the function of il-33, as deletion of the nuclear domain in mice results in high levels of circulating il-33 and lethal inflammation in multiple organs5. il-33 also lacks a conventional signal sequence1. the mechanism of extracellular release of stored il-33 was thought to involve cellular injury or necrosis, and thus, il-33 was given the name alarmin6. later research indicated either that exposure to allergens of the fungus alternaria quickly induces extracellular release of mature il-33 in airway epithelial cells in an atp- and [ca2+]i-dependent manner without apparent signs of cell death7, or that extracellular release of full-length il-33 after exposure to various allergens, including alternaria, occurs through cellular injury8. more recently, caspase-8-dependent processing and secretion of the biologically active n-terminal il-33 fragment was observed over an 8-hour period after allergen exposure9, indicating that the mechanisms that regulate il-33 release are complex and might be dependent on the experimental model and allergens.bacterial infection and activation of pattern-recognition receptors (prrs) activate several inflammatory caspases, including caspase 1, which culminates in the activation of the executioner protein family of gasdermins10. many allergens that are implicated in human diseases, including house dust mites (hdms) and fungi, have intrinsic protease activities. to investigate the mechanisms of il-33 release induced by allergens, chen et al.3 used the cysteine protease papain as a model for allergens and found that il-33 rapidly disappeared from the nucleus of mouse alveolar type 2 mle-12 cells or human alveolar epithelial a549 cells after exposure to papain. il-33 was detected in the extracellular medium, and the authors also found that full-length gsdmd was cleaved to a mouse 40-kda or a human 35-kda n-terminal fragment, respectively, in the cellular lysates. importantly, no morphological changes associated with cell death were observed. thus, exposure to the protease papain induces rapid gsdmd fragmentation and non-cytotoxic extracellular release of il-33 in airway epithelial cells in mice and humans.gsdmd consists of an n-terminal pore-forming domain, a linker region and a c-terminal regulatory domain11. activated caspase 1 typically cleaves mouse gsdmd at position d276 (d275 in human gsdmd), leading to oligomerization of the n-terminal fragment and formation of membrane pores through which mature il-1β or il-18 is released to the extracellular space. however, papain-induced activation of gsdmd did not seem to follow this conventional pathway. chen et al.3 found that stimulation of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (bmdms) with the conventional pyroptotic agent lps plus atp induced release of il-1β and generated a canonical n-terminal 35-kda gsdmd fragment. this process was dependent on caspase 1, as expected, and was accompanied by cell death. by contrast, exposure of bmdms to papain induced the release of il-33 and the appearance of the n-terminal 40-kda gsdmd fragment, and these outcomes were not affected by a deficiency in caspase 1 or by treatment with a pan-caspase antagonist. furthermore, other allergen proteases involved in type 2 immunity, such as aspergillus protease, hdm extract and the hdm components der p and der f, reproduced the results observed with papain, suggesting that exposure to proteases triggers non-canonical activation of gsdmd and il-33 release.to investigate the role of this newly described n-terminal 40-kda gsdmd fragment (p40 nt-gsdmd), chen et al.3 performed structural and functional analyses by expressing truncated gsdmd fragments and il-33 without the nuclear localization domain in hek293 cells. as expected, the canonical n-terminal gsdmd fragment (amino acids 1–276) induced marked release of il-33 and ldh, the latter used as a marker of cell death. the newly described p40 nt-gsdmd (amino acids 1–311) induced comparable release of il-33 but minimal release of ldh, suggesting that the p40 nt-gsdmd retained the ability to assemble into membrane pores, which could be selective for small proteins (that is, 20-kda il-33 compared to 140-kda ldh). furthermore, mutations affecting residues 309–313 of gsdmd abolished the papain-induced generation of the p40 nt-gsdmd, suggesting that the 309–313 segment harbored the cleavage site.caspase-mediated fragmentation of gsdmd and subsequent release of il-1β and il-18 generally contribute to immunity against microorganisms and a variety of inflammatory disorders10. chen et al.3 used gsdmd−/− mice to investigate the significance of gsdmd in type 2 immunity and allergic airway diseases. consistent with the in vitro observations, airway exposure to papain in naive wild-type mice induced il-33 release into the airway lumen within 1 hour; this il-33 release was partially reduced in gsdmd−/− mice. importantly, when wild-type mice were exposed repeatedly to papain or hdms, they developed asthma-like airway pathology and exhibited airway eosinophilia, high levels of il-5 and il-13, and an increased number of ilc2s. these pathological changes were suppressed in gsdmd−/− mice. furthermore, in patients with asthma, a positive correlation was observed between airway expression of gsdmd and the levels of il-33 within the airway lumen, providing further evidence to support the role of gsdmd in mediating il-33 release and type 2 immunity in vivo.the gsdmd pathway convincingly explains the mechanism involved in secretion of il-33 from the cytoplasm to the extracellular milieu, but questions remain as to how chromatin-bound il-33 is mobilized to the cytoplasm. chen et al.3 proposed a possible role for stress granules (sgs) in this process. when exposed to various cellular stressors, such as oxidative stress, hypoxia, osmotic pressure changes and exposure to toxins, eukaryotic cells assemble membrane-less sg particles that are enriched in rna-binding proteins and rna12. these sgs may serve as cellular stress processing centers where various upstream signaling pathways converge. chen et al.3 found that when a549 cells expressing il-33–gfp are exposed to the canonical cell stress inducer arsenite, il-33–gfp loses its nuclear localization and localizes to cytoplasmic sgs. however, unlike papain, arsenite did not induce extracellular release of il-33, probably due to a lack of gsdmd pore formation. mel-12 cells exposed to proteases such as papain or proteases from aspergillus or hdms also produced il-33-containing sgs. these findings suggest that sgs may serve as vehicles that carry il-33 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, making it available for extracellular release through p40 nt-gsdmd pores (fig. 1).the results from chen et al.3 elegantly demonstrate the role of gsdmd in the extracellular release of il-33 in airway epithelial cells exposed to allergen proteases. thus, gsdmd may have a dual function in mediating extracellular release of il-1 family cytokines, depending on the microbial and environmental triggers (fig. 1). canonical pores with a 35-kda gsdmd fragment (in mice) are involved in the secretion of il-1β and il-18 and pyroptosis in response to bacterial products and other prr ligands, while pores with a 40-kda gsdmd fragment promote extracellular secretion of il-33 without apparent cell death in response to environmental allergen proteases. indeed, polymorphisms in gsdmb, another gasdermin protein, have been implicated in asthma in humans2. it remains to be determined which endogenous enzyme(s) cleave gsdmd to the active 40-kda fragment in mice or the 35-kda fragment in humans, and whether, or how, full-length il-33 is processed within the nucleus and is dissociated from chromatin and assembled into sgs. another major question is how the biochemical signals generated at the cell membrane and/or the cytoplasm in response to protease exposure are communicated to the nucleus to mobilize il-33. nonetheless, the identification of gsdmd as a molecule involved in the non-cytotoxic extracellular release of il-33 extends our knowledge of allergen-induced type 2 immunity and the immunobiology of il-33, and opens a window for further investigations into the immunological and molecular mechanisms involved in the production, storage and secretion of this intriguing cytokine.cayrol, c. et al. immunol. rev. 281, 154–168 (2018).cas
