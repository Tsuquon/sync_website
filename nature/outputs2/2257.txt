the bureau of land management (blm) and the u.s. forest service signed a first-of-its-kind agreement last week to comanage bears ears national monument in southeastern utah with five native american tribes. the five tribes have long wanted to help oversee this culturally significant monument, a 550,000-hectare expanse pocked by burnt-sienna buttes, 1000-year-old indigenous dwellings, and ceremonial sites. the comanagement agreement is meant to incorporate the traditional knowledge and expertise of the tribesâ€the hopi, navajo nation, ute mountain ute tribe, ute indian tribe of the uintah and ouray reservation, and the pueblo of zuniâ€and center their voices in land use decisions. the indigenous tribes will now submit a draft land management plan to blm in the coming weeks, which could then take up to 18 months to finalize.psyche, the $967 million nasa mission to explore the strange metal asteroid of the same name, will not launch this fall because of delays in testing its navigation software, the agency announced last week. the mission, developed by the jet propulsion laboratory, is likely to launch next year, but could also slip to 2024; either date would see its arrival at the main-belt asteroid, which was set for 2026, fall back by 3 years or more. an independent panel will review what went wrong and decide whether the mission will continueâ€although cancellation is unlikely. the delay should not limit the science conducted by the spacecraft, which aims to investigate whether the asteroid is the leftover core of an early planetary embryo.officials in the united kingdom declared a â€œnational incidentâ€� last week after poliovirus was detected in samples taken between february and june from one of londonâ€™s main sewage treatment plants. the source is still a mystery, but it is likely that someone from outside the united kingdom who recently received the oral polio vaccineâ€which uses a live, but weakened, poliovirusâ€is shedding the pathogen in their feces. no polio cases have been found and such sewage detections are not unusualâ€signs of the virus usually disappear quickly. this time, however, it continued to appear over many months, and several closely related versions of the virus were in recent samples. the genetic changes suggest the virus is evolving, a sign it may be spreading in a small number of people. the united kingdomâ€™s generally high polio vaccine coverage should limit further transmission, infectious disease experts sayâ€but they worry lower rates in some london communities might leave children there vulnerable.the national cancer institute (nci) plans to evaluate the growing number of tests from companies that screen for multiple cancers by detecting traces of tumor dna and proteins in a personâ€™s blood. last month, nci advisers endorsed a $75 million, 4-year pilot study that will enroll 24,000 seemingly cancer-free volunteers starting in 2023 or 2024. some would only get standard cancer screening, such as mammograms, whereas others would also receive one of the experimental blood tests. if the pilot study goes well, nci expects to launch a bigger trial, with perhaps 300,000 participants ages 45 to 70, that would last 7 to 8 years. such a long-term study could reveal whether these tests, which can return false positives and lead to unnecessary procedures on tiny, slow-growing tumors, ultimately save lives.austria, one of the first countries in europe to pass a covid-19 vaccine mandate, officially rescinded the requirement last week. the law, passed in november 2021 with support across the political spectrum, required all adults to be vaccinated by february or face fines of up to â‚¬3600 ($3800). however, the government never enforced it. by march, the government said the omicron variant, which evades vaccine protection better than previous versions of sars-cov-2, meant the mandate was no longer justified. last week, austriaâ€™s health minister said the law had failed to persuade the vaccine-hesitant and had been more divisive than helpful. he said the government would now focus on explaining why receiving a booster dose is important. austria has one of the lower vaccination rates in europe, with fewer than 75% of the population fully vaccinated.the e-cigarette manufacturer juul last week won a temporary reprieve from a u.s. food and drug administration (fda) order banning the company from selling its products in the country. the 23 june fda order would affect all juul products in the united states, including flavored cartridges and pods for vaping. it came as part of a larger agency effort to curb high rates of teen vaping and other public health crises fueled by nicotine use. earlier last week, for instance, fda announced it would be mandating lower nicotine levels in traditional cigarettes. a federal appeals court granted juul time to file a formal challenge to the fda order, which the company asserts is the product of political maneuvering.the u.s. house of representatives last week released proposed 2023 budgets for key research agencies (below). the senate has yet to release its proposals, and final numbers likely wonâ€™t be set until late this year.the title of most cited medical journal has changed hands for the first time in 45 years. in 2021, the lancet overtook the new england journal of medicine (nejm) as the publication with the highest impact factor, according to a report released this week by the analytics firm clarivate. the company manages the web of science database used to generate this controversial citation measure, and nejm has dominated the general and internal medicine category since clarivateâ€™s journal citation reports launched in the 1970s. high-profile pandemic research may explain the shift: the lancet published three of the 10 most cited articles in 2021, all of them related to covid-19.
