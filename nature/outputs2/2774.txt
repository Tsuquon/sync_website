flood barriers in venice, italy, may cause important salt marshes in its lagoon to drown by starving them of sediment they need to keep up with sea level rise, a study has found. to combat a growing incidence of major flooding, venice spent billions of euros to build three barriers that can temporarily close the lagoon off from the mediterranean sea. but the barriers also block stormwater that moves sediment to the marshes, and after they began operating in october 2020, the rate of sedimentation of the marshes fell by 25%, davide tognin, a ph.d. student at the university of padua, and colleagues write in this week in nature geoscience. thatâ€™s worrisome because the marshes provide habitats for wildlife, store carbon, and help clean nutrient pollution from the water. adjusting when the barriers are deployed could allow more storm-carried sediment to reach the marshes, the authors say.the drug company merck & co. last week reported its covid-19 antiviral pill works less well than preliminary data suggested. in a press release, merck announced that molnupiravir, which is designed to be taken within days of symptom onset, slices the risk of hospitalization and death by 30%, based on an analysis of the 1433 participants enrolled in its clinical trial. thatâ€™s down from the 50% reduction merck announced on 1 october based on an interim analysis of the first 762 participants. the difference between interim and final results appears largely due to lower risk of hospitalization or death in the placebo group, with the rate dropping from 14.1% in the interim analysis to 9.7% in the final one. among participants getting the antiviral, the chance of hospitalization or death went from 7.3% to 6.8% when all the volunteers were studied. this week, a u.s. advisory committee narrowly recommended its use, suggesting restrictions on who should have access given concerns about side effects.the worldâ€™s largest covid-19 vaccine testing network announced last week it will expand to support development of vaccines against other diseases that could cause a global health crisis. the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi), a partnership of public and private donors, last year launched a multicontinent laboratory network that aimed to hasten covid-19 vaccine development by standardizing the reagents and protocols used in preclinical and early clinical testing of vaccines. thirty developers of covid-19 vaccines are using the network to assess whether their candidate can advance to late-stage clinical trials. now, cepi says the network will assess vaccines against other diseases that could cause an epidemic or pandemic, including lassa fever, middle east respiratory syndrome, nipah, chikungunya, and rift valley fever. it will also prepare for â€œdisease xâ€�â€the as-yet-unknown pathogen that might one day cause the next pandemic. the expansion aims to draw in laboratories in regions where the network currently has no presence, including africa, oceania, and south america.germanyâ€™s new coalition governmentâ€which will replace that of retiring chancellor angela merkelâ€last week named a research minister and laid out policy priorities for science, including strengthening universities and boosting research spending to 3.5% of gross domestic product. in their agreement to form a government, the coalitionâ€which includes the social democratic party, the greens, and the free democratic party (fdp)â€also outlines plans to protect biodiversity and reduce germanyâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions enough to meet a global 1.5â°c warming limit. the pact does not mention the regulation of genetically modified crops, a point of disagreement between the greens and fdp. the designated research and education minister is bettina stark-watzinger, an fdp member who led a banking and finance research institute before being elected to parliament. social democrat olaf scholz is expected to become chancellor next week, after the parties approve the coalition agreement.u.s. representative eddie bernice johnson (dâ€tx), who championed increased federal support for research and expanding opportunities in science for women and people of color during her 3 decades in washington, d.c., plans to retire from congress at the end of 2022. the first black woman to chair the committee, johnson has teamed with the panelâ€™s top republican, representative frank lucas (ok), to stake out a centrist position on issues ranging from combating climate change and stamping out research misconduct to addressing chinaâ€™s growing scientific prowess.the event horizon telescope (eht), a global array of radio telescopes that in 2019 produced the first image of a black hole, will sharpen its vision with the addition in namibia of the african millimetre telescope, the first such instrument on the continent. the project was approved this week after radboud university in the netherlands agreed to support the project with â‚¬1 million per year for operations and â‚¬1.9 million toward its expected â‚¬10 million construction costs. the team is negotiating with other institutions to secure the remaining funding. eht achieves high resolution by combining data from widely space radio dishesâ€from france to hawaii and greenland to antarcticaâ€into a virtual earth-size dish. the 15-meter dish in africa will help the project pursue its goal of capturing a movie of black hole activity. namibian astronomers will gain opportunities to join the black hole project and carry out their own observations.human geneticists have mostly abandoned the word â€œraceâ€�â€which refers to socially determined categories rather than biological groupsâ€to describe populations in their papers, a study of a leading genetics journal has found. examining 11,635 papers published from 1949 to 2018 by the american journal of human genetics, researchers found that the use of â€œraceâ€� decreased from 22% of papers in the first decade to 5% in the last. during the same period, the journalâ€™s authors increasingly employed termsâ€â€œethnicity,â€� â€œancestry,â€� and location-based names such as â€œafrican,â€� â€œasian,â€� and â€œeuropeanâ€�â€perceived as more useful for describing human biological variation. such changes may reflect a growing consensus among the journalâ€™s authors that â€œraceâ€� is â€œa social category with biological consequences,â€� the team writes this week in the journal. acknowledging that earlier geneticists helped shape the racial categories still used today, the american society of human genetics, which publishes the journal, this week announced a project to explore past injustices perpetrated through genetics.one personâ€™s trash is anotherâ€™s treasure. in 1914, albert einstein apparently meant to discard a sheaf of not-quite-right calculations he used to test his then-incomplete theory of gravity, the general theory of relativity. last week, the documents sold for $15 million, christieâ€™s auction house announced. they include 26 pages in einsteinâ€™s hand, 25 in that of michele bessoâ€a swiss-italian engineer whom einstein called â€œthe best sounding board in europeâ€�â€and three written by both. in those pages, the two struggle to explain why the axis of mercuryâ€™s elliptical orbit shifts forward on each circuit like the hand of a clock. in 1915, einstein succeeded in using general relativity to explain how the sunâ€™s gravity is responsible for the peculiarities of mercuryâ€™s orbit.a decline in water flow expected from andes snowmelt, caused by warming global temperatures, has made a hydroelectric plant planned in chile financially unsustainable, a u.s. utility told a bankruptcy court last month. the aes corporation, sponsor of the alto maipo project, had based its viability on a 59-year record of water flow levels, bloomberg quint reported. but diminished flow in 2021 would have yielded only about half the electricity generation expected. on 17 november, aes asked the court for permission to restructure the projectâ€™s finances so it can be completed and begin operations in 2022 using the lower flow.
