on the morning of 24 february, conservation biologist anton vlaschenko awoke to the sound of shelling outside his apartment in kharkiv, ukraine. the first thing he did was eat a big breakfast. then, he headed straight to the ukrainian bat rehabilitation center; the bat rescue and research facility is the largest of its kind in eastern europe. â€œi didnâ€™t know if we would return home, or what would happen next,â€� he says. â€œbut i understood the war had begun, and we needed to do something.â€�worried that the cityâ€™s power would be cut, vlaschenko spent the next 24 hours transferring hundreds of rescued bats hibernating in the centerâ€™s refrigerators to special cages for release. as the winged mammals flew into the frigid night to look for new spots to spend the remaining winter, vlaschenko heard gunfire in the streets: the first russian troops to enter the city outskirts were clashing with the ukrainian army.next, vlaschenko moved the centerâ€™s collection of more than 2000 nyctalus noctula bat skullsâ€each carefully padded with shredded newspaper and labeled and stored in a numbered matchboxâ€to his apartment, an hourâ€™s walk away. more than a week later, the skulls are still there, wrapped in plastic shopping bags by the door in case they need to be moved again in a hurry. he also brought home rescued bats too sick to release.â€œwe had a huge explosion close to my home 2 days ago,â€� vlaschenko said in a call this week from his apartment, the peeps of bats audible in the background. â€œyou never know what moment you could be hit.â€�as war rages, vlaschenko and researchers across ukraine are scrambling to protect, hide, or evacuate irreplaceable specimens, collections, and data. one group is uploading 3d scans of fossils to colleagues abroad, and a loosely organized international effort has sprung up to save digital data from ukrainian scientific and cultural collections to servers outside the country.for heritage experts, the threat to ukraineâ€™s scientific collections and cultural monuments is frighteningly familiar from recent conflicts in iraq, syria, mali, and elsewhere. â€œhow do you protect museums? you canâ€™t move the buildings, or the infrastructure,â€� unesco world heritage centre director lazare eloundou assomo says. â€œyou try to protect collections by relocating them to shelters or refuges, where you have to hide and store them until the war is finished.â€�in a blog post days after the russian invasion began, national museum of the history of ukraine director fedir androshchuk said his museum in central kyiv and others across the country had done just that, dismantling exhibitions with artifacts such as scythian weapons or a mammoth tusk bracelet from the last ice age and moving them to secure spots for safekeeping. androshchuk fears â€œeventual damages caused by rocket strikes, shelling and bombing,â€� he wrote in an email to science this week. â€œthere is no guarantee that ukrainian heritage will be safe.â€�in the early days of the war, when some predicted kyiv would fall quickly, it wasnâ€™t clear how much time museum staff had. â€œthey were working against the clock,â€� says mads holst, director of the moesgaard museum in aarhus, denmark, who has been in touch with androshchuk since the war began. â€œthey had a very specific task and they took it up very courageously.â€�in what holst calls a â€œhappy accident,â€� more than 1000 objects from the national museum of the history of ukraine and regional museums had already been shipped to his museum for an exhibit, rus â€ vikings in the east. â€œthere are burial assemblages, hoard findsâ€theyâ€™re quite significant objects,â€� holst says. â€œthereâ€™s still quite a lot to be explored and researched about their provenance and history.â€�many ukrainians view the period between 800 and 1050 c.e., when kyiv was founded as a viking trading outpost, as the beginning of their national identityâ€an interpretation many russians, including president vladimir putin, deny. now secure and on display in denmark, â€œthese objects are part of this conflict, which is partly about whether ukraine is allowed to have an independent historical identity,â€� holst says.other researchers are turning to fragile internet connections to save their collections digitally. pavel golâ€™din, an evolutionary zoologist at the schmalhausen institute of zoology in kyiv, is far from the front linesâ€for nowâ€in the southwestern ukrainian city of chernivtsi. but he studies cetacean evolution, and his work relies in part on massive fossils 10 meters long or more, from ukraine and elsewhere, which would be nearly impossible to move, evacuate, or stuff in a safe.over the past 2 years, he led a project to scan marine mammal fossils from collections across ukraine, most between 40 million and 7 million years old. â€œwe created a 3d archive of extinct and extant specimens, some unique,â€� he says. â€œour archive is four terabytes of dataâ€itâ€™s quite a big collection.â€�when war broke out, the scans were mostly stored on hard drives in kyiv and kharkiv. to make sure at least the scans survive, one of golâ€™dinâ€™s students in kharkiv is transferring data to colleagues in france in the midst of russian bombardments. â€œwhen he has an internet connection, heâ€™s uploading files,â€� golâ€™din says. â€œbut kharkiv is under continuous shelling, and he is under a lot of risk.â€�golâ€™din hopes to help avert a repeat of the catastrophes that befell paleontology during world war ii, when bombs and fire destroyed countless fossils in museums from munich to milan and kyiv. â€œi think we will win,â€� he says. â€œwe will be able to start again.â€�outside of ukraine, volunteers in europe and the united states have launched saving ukrainian cultural heritage online, or sucho. what started a few days after the invasion as a project to save digitized music collections quickly turned into an effort to preserve the online repositories of more than 1000 ukrainian cultural and scientific institutions, including small local archaeology museums, major archives, and rare book collections.within days, archivists, librarians, and programmers from around the world began to copy the complete websites of ukrainian cultural institutions. using automated computer programs and volunteers manually copying files, they began sweeping up everything online from pdfs of journal articles and scans of rare books to 3d tours of museum collections.the urgency of the task quickly became clear. a few days after they started their work, sucho volunteers captured the website of the state archives of kharkivâ€105 gigabytes of data, including scans of rare books and scientific records. â€œfour hours later, the whole website went down,â€� says sebastian majstorovic, a historian and it consultant at the austrian center for digital humanities and cultural heritage in vienna. â€œbecause of the way the internet [architecture] works, anything attached to ukraine in any way is in danger.â€�as ukraineâ€™s internet infrastructure comes under increasing pressure, â€œweâ€™re focusing on grabbing as much as we can,â€� majstorovic says. â€œthe real threat is servers in ukraine might get destroyed or just disconnected.â€� so far, over 5 terabytes of data have been stored on servers outside the country, and more files have been saved to the internet archive. other institutions, including the german archaeological institute and the ukrainian research institute at harvard university, which focuses on the countryâ€™s culture and history, are providing secure storage for individual researchers in ukraine to upload data and research materials.institute of archaeology of the national academy of sciences of ukraine researcher artem borysov, for example, has worked with sucho and colleagues at the german archaeological institute to upload over 100 gigabytes of excavation drawings, photographs, and spatial data from cherkasy regional museum hard drives to secure servers outside ukraine. the transfer included documentation from decades of fieldwork on settlements and grave mounds from between 3000 and 2300 b.c.e., the heyday of the yamnaya culture. these nomadic herders arose on the steppes of ukraine and russia, then spread, leaving a lasting genetic mark on most people in europe.his next task is to try to get 4 terabytes of documentation from his institute to german archaeological institute servers, including records from a recent excavation of a 10th century c.e. cemetery on the banks of the rosâ€™ river. called ostriv, the siteâ€™s burials look like they belong to people living in the eastern baltic, far to the north and westâ€another strand in the story of ukraineâ€™s origins in the viking era. â€œmost of the data is photocopies of documents from the archive,â€� including field reports from the last 15 years,â€� borysov wrote in an email earlier this week. â€œthis process is still ongoing, because the data transfer rate is very low.â€�back in kharkiv, vlaschenkoâ€™s bat center has lost just a few windows so far, and its power is still on. vlaschenko makes regular â€œraidsâ€� on foot through the embattled city to check on the labâ€™s seven freezers full of bat carcasses, which represent another irreplaceable specimen collection for immunology, parasitology, and climate research. the centerâ€™s veterinarian and a few volunteers have stayed in the city to feed and care for bats too sick to release.the collections represent decades of workâ€and the hope that ukrainian science can recover after the war. vlaschenko says the bat skulls in his apartment could hold clues to recent evolution in n. noctula: the bats around kharkiv have shifted their migratory patterns since the late 1990s, he says, becoming sedentary rather than migrating long distances, and the skulls could hold clues to how city life changed them. â€œone day, maybe we can see how bats adapt to urbanization from changes in their skulls over time,â€�â€but only if the skulls survive the war.â€œwhen something like this happens the specimens that survive are crazy important for future research,â€� vlaschenko says. â€œyou can buy new equipment or build new buildings, but you canâ€™t get back individual specimens.â€�
