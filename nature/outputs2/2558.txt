on the shores of a great lake in the cretaceous period, dinosaurs, fish, and crocodiles lived and died. for the next 100 million years, conditions were just right to preserve their bodies. during the past century, paleontologists joyfully excavated thousands of fossil specimens from what are now commercial limestone quarries in the araripe basin in northeastern brazil. but most of those paleontologists were not from brazil, and nearly half of the specimens now reside half a world away from their burial place, in german museums, according to a new study that collated who stores and analyzes fossils from key sites in brazil and mexico.the work adds data to the ongoing ethical debates about what the authors call paleontological colonialism, in which middle- and low-income countries supply data and specimens for high-income ones, local collaboratorsâ€™ contributions are devalued, and local laws are trivialized.the study â€œis really game changing,â€� says jeff liston, a paleontologist at the national museums scotland in edinburgh. â€œelevating this stuff from the anecdotal and quantifying it like this is the only way that weâ€™re going to make any progressâ€� in decolonizing paleontology. last year, an ethics controversy erupted over a science paper by a mostly european team describing a stunning shark fossil from mexico. in the wake of the debate, brazilian paleontologists, who had been mounting a fierce social media campaign to repatriate a dinosaur fossil stored at the state museum of natural history karlsruhe (smnk) in germany, teamed up with researchers from mexico and other countries to explore colonialism in paleontology publications. the researchers defined colonial science as work that doesnâ€™t include local authors affiliated with research institutions, houses fossils abroad, and publishes on specimens that were likely purchased, a practice outlawed in both countries.nussaã¯bah raja schoob, a paleobiologist at the friedrich alexander university of erlangen-nuremberg in germany, and her colleagues focused on the past 3 decades of publications from the araripe basin and three fossil-rich regions in mexico. to keep their task manageable, they flagged papers with colonial practices among the first 100 results from a google scholar search of papers in english describing fossils from these regions. they also included additional papers from teams they knew had worked in the region or studies they happened to be aware of. for brazilian fossils, because there were so many papers, the researchers restricted their search to vertebrate and plant holotypesâ€specimens used to describe a new species.in all, the team examined about 200 such publications. about half were first authored by researchers not from brazil or mexico. of those, about half lacked any local researchers as co-authors. â€œthatâ€™s quite a lot,â€� says lead author juan carlos cisneros, a paleontologist at the federal university of piauã­ in brazil. â€œthat means half of the expertise being developed doesnâ€™t stay in that local country, it stays in the global north.â€� up to 80% of the publications did not state whether the authors obtained permits for fieldwork or export of the specimens, although both nations require such permission, the team reports today in royal society open science.in mexico, most specimens stayed in the country, although some are housed in private museums. but in brazil, 90% of holotype fossils described by foreign researchers were housed in foreign collections, which goes against brazilian law. about 40% of all brazilian holotypes of vertebrates and plants in the study are stored in museums in germany.â€œitâ€™s just shocking to me how much of it is in germany,â€� says margaret lewis, a vertebrate paleontologist at stockton university in new jersey.but some of the researchers whose work is criticized say the paper amounts to little more than a personal attack. â€œi think itâ€™s horrendously biased,â€� says paleontologist david martill from the university of portsmouth in the united kingdom, who wrote a number of papers cited by the new study. â€œand by and large, it seems to attack two people: myself and dino frey.â€� two years ago, martill and eberhard â€œdinoâ€� frey, a paleontologist at the smnk, came under fire when they describedâ€with no brazilian co-authorsâ€a rare dinosaur from brazil they called ubirajara jubatus, in the journal cretaceous research. the fossil was then stored at smnk. after an intense and sometimes aggressive social media campaign to repatriate the fossilâ€supported by most of the authors of the new studyâ€the journal withdrew the paper. smnk received bomb and arson threats. â€œthat was a very, very irresponsible campaign,â€� martill says. a spokesperson for the ministry of science, research and the arts of baden-wã¼rttemberg state in germany, which manages smnk, told science that after an investigation, it is ready to return the fossil as soon as it receives an official repatriation request from the brazilian government. nearly half of the cretaceous vertebrate and plant fossils unearthed in brazilâ€™s araripe basin in the past 3 decades are housed abroad, mostly in germany.the new study, martill says, focuses too much on germany, largely ignoring brazilian fossils stored at the american museum of natural history in new york city, and other collections outside brazil. â€œwithout a doubt, they cherry-picked them.â€�another german paleontologist, wolfgang stinnesbeck, agrees. retired from heidelberg university in germany, stinnesbeck has worked for 35 years in northeastern mexico and several of his papers are singled out in the new study. he says, â€œthe essential objective of this paper is doing us harm.â€� he says he has always collaborated with mexican colleagues and used german funding to train local paleontologists. all the mexican fossils his team has described, he says, have remained in mexico; he says his work is not representative of what the authors call paleontological colonialism. he says personal conflict is behind some of the new paperâ€™s charges. â€œa group of nationalistic activists is out to get rid of their foreign competitors by virtually destroying their credibility and reputation,â€� he says.liston agrees that the paper seems unusually focused on germany: â€œamerica seems to get a free pass in a lot of these situations. and iâ€™m never convinced that thereâ€™s a good reason why.â€�but raja schoob says, â€œwe only based [the paper] on facts. there was no speculation. â€¦ weâ€™re just not attacking one person.â€�lewis, who is the ethics officer and vice president of the society of vertebrate paleontology (svp), says the paper highlights a pattern that many were aware of but hadnâ€™t thought about deeply until recently. â€œmany of us who are in these colonialist countries â€¦ we donâ€™t always know when weâ€™re making mistakes,â€� she says.journals and professional associations are taking steps to end colonial practices. current biology and cretaceous research, for example, have recently set up guidelines for authors on how to report export permits and specimensâ€™ provenance. svp recently updated its ethics code to include recommendations to curb paleontological colonialism, and the european association of vertebrate palaeontologists, of which liston is president, plans to release its first code of ethics soon. â€œthis is a start,â€� raja schoob says.but many think documentation of following local rules isnâ€™t enoughâ€repatriation is crucial. â€œi find myself agreeing with a lot of the sentiments about fossils being returned to brazil,â€� martill says. â€œas a scientist, iâ€™ve always just simply put the fossils first and not the nations, but as this debate carries on, iâ€™m more and more softening my approach.â€�
