about 330 million years ago in what’s now montana, a squidlike creature died in a tropical bay and its soft body was preserved in limestone. now, paleontologists at the american museum of natural history and yale university have studied the fossilized remains and named the unusual 10-armed creature in honor of u.s. president joe biden.the creature was about 12 centimeters long and had a torpedo-shaped body, with a pair of fins at one end that likely helped stabilize it as it swam. it also had an ink sack and 10 sucker-bearing arms (see image, above), the scientists report today in nature communications. two of the arms seem to be longer than the rest, similar to the two long tentacles that accompany the eight arms of modern-day squid. (cephalopod arms have suckers throughout, which help them grasp prey, whereas tentacles only have suckers at the very end.)the researchers say the animal is the oldest known vampyropod—an ancestor of modern octopuses and vampire squids (despite their name, vampire squids are not classified as squids—they inhabit their own branch of the tree of life.) the fossil dates to about 330 million years ago, which corroborates genetic studies indicating vampyropods diverged from their squid ancestors around that time. although the creature appears to have had 10 robust and functional extremities, its modern-day descendants have done away with the extra pair: vampire squids only have two vestigial filaments, and octopuses have lost the arm pair entirely.the scientists named the creature syllipsimopodi bideni. the genus name comes from the greek for prehensile foot, which the scientists chose because this is the oldest known cephalopod with suckers. and they say they chose the species name to to celebrate the recently inaugurated (at the time of submission) 46th president of the united states.
