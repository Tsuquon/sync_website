the fearsome boa constrictor (boa constrictor) lives up to its name. whenever it’s hungry, the 4-meter-long snake wraps itself around rodents, birds, or even pigs, literally squeezing the life out of them. so why don’t boas collapse their own lungs in the process?to find out, scientists strapped a blood pressure cuff (like the one your doctor uses) around the midsections of eight boas in their lab. this restricted motion in certain rib regions, as might happen when the snake throttles a rat or other snack. they then used x-ray video to capture how the ribs moved, measured each animal’s airflow, and tracked their muscle movements by implanting electrodes in their lungs, all while squeezing the cuff.as the researchers moved the cuff up and down their bodies, the boas shifted their breathing to use the ribs that weren’t gripped by the cuff, the team reports today in the journal of experimental biology. when the cuff was tightened closer to the snake’s tail—as might happen in some constriction positions—the animal used the ribs closer to its head to suck air into the blood vessel–rich sections at the top of the lungs (see first part of video, above). but when the cuff was tightened on the ribs close to the animal’s head (see second part of video)—as might happen during other constriction postures—the snake used its lower lung section to pull air through the front lungs where oxygen is absorbed like a fireplace bellows, the team says.the strategy helps boa constrictors get enough oxygen—even if they’re squeezing an animal bigger than the width of their body. without this rib-alternating breathing, the snakes likely would never have evolved their constricting capabilities or preference for such large prey, the scientists say.
