it sounds like the stuff of science fiction: two closely related species hybridize and create a superorganism whose growth and expansion seems unstoppable. that’s what’s happened in western australia’s shark bay, researchers say, where a seagrass meadow (see above) stemming from a single hybrid plant has extended its reach across more than 180 kilometers—an area the size of washington, d.c.two years ago, scientists discovered some of the seagrass there was a clone of a poseidon’s ribbon weed (posidonia australis) that had 40 chromosomes instead of the typical 20. they think half those chromosomes may come from the ribbon weed and half from an unknown species.that second half appears to have provided a big survival advantage, as this hybrid has taken over all but one of the 10 seagrass meadows surveyed, the scientists report today in the proceedings of the royal society b. the clone is about 1.5 orders of magnitude larger than the largest fungi and the longest sea animal.the team suspects the clone arose 4500 years ago and has been spreading ever since. that would make it among the oldest organisms on earth, although not quite as old as the oldest tree.shark bay is at the northern edge of where this seagrass can survive, and global warming is making it harder for the plants to hang on there. low rainfall and high evaporation rates have also caused the water to become much saltier. the clone’s extra genes may be providing a way for it to adapt to these stresses, the authors note.
