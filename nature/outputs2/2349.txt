with the covid-19 pandemic still raging, a second public health threat has the world on high alert: a global outbreak of monkeypox. as of 26 may, two dozen countries in the americas, europe, north africa, the middle east, and australia had reported more than 350 suspected and confirmed cases of the disease, a much milder cousin of smallpox, the deadly scourge that the world health organization (who) deemed eradicated in 1980. a disproportionate number of cases are in men who have sex with men (msm), an unusual twist given that researchers have never convincingly shown sexual transmission occurs in monkeypox.monkeypox is endemic in west and central africa, and the virus occasionally causes outbreaks elsewhere in the world, but most are quickly contained or peter out by themselves. this outbreak looks very different, says anne rimoin, an epidemiologist at the university of california, los angeles, who has long studied monkeypox in the democratic republic of the congo (drc). â€œwe get concerned when we see a virus doing things that we donâ€™t normally see it doing,â€� rimoin says. â€œwe now have to really reevaluate what we know about monkeypoxâ€which has all been gleaned, essentially, from low-resource settings in africaâ€in very, very different kinds of populations.â€�â€œwe should definitely be concerned about this new situation,â€� agrees epidemiologist rosamund lewis, head of poxvirus diseases at who. still, lewis stresses that monkeypox, which causes skin lesions resembling those of smallpox, is not easily transmitted, and its spread can typically be limited by isolating cases. â€œitâ€™s not a concern for most people,â€� she says. whatâ€™s more, several drugs and vaccines developed for smallpox can also treat and prevent monkeypox.a who technical advisory group that specializes in infectious hazards, chaired by epidemiologist and monkeypox veteran david heymann of the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine, met last week to develop recommendations covering everything from the need for more aggressive surveillance to the use of vaccines. in a 23 may rapid risk assessment, the european centre for disease prevention and control warned thereâ€™s a â€œpotential riskâ€� for human-to-animal transmission, which could enable the virus to become established in european wildlife, as it is in africa.u.k. officials on 7 may were the first to report a monkeypox case, a patient who had arrived from nigeria 3 days earlier. but that person apparently did not transmit the virus to anyone else and is not the source of the wider outbreak; public health officials in montreal say a man there had symptoms as early as 29 april. at the time, he wasnâ€™t tested for monkeypox. most doctors would not think to do so because the disease is vanishingly rare outside of africa and its lesions can resemble those of chickenpox and syphilis. portuguese doctors collected a sample on 4 may from a baffling case but didnâ€™t test it for monkeypox eitherâ€until they learned of the unusual clusters of cases in the united kingdom. â€œno one could imagine a case of monkeypox,â€� says joã£o paulo gomes at portugalâ€™s national institute of health.given the torrent of cases reported over the past 2 weeks, itâ€™s possible the virus has been spreading under the radar for months, heymann says. he expects â€œmany more casesâ€� to come to light in the days and weeks ahead. rimoin says a much larger outbreak could be underway in nigeria and nearby countries, from which the disease might have been exported repeatedly to the rest of the world. â€œweâ€™re not looking for these kinds of things, and if you donâ€™t look for them, you donâ€™t find them,â€� she says."monkeypox" is a misnomer; the virus was discovered in 1958 in research monkeys, but its natural hosts are likely rodents and other small mammals. the virus first surfaced in humans in 1970 in what is now the drc, causing fever, headaches, and lymph node swelling followed by an eruption of pus-filled blisters. outbreaks occur occasionally in sub-saharan africa after someone comes in contact with an infected wild animal, and infected travelers sometimes carry the disease to other countries. the biggest known outbreak in the united states occurred in 2003, when 47 people were infected by pet prairie dogs that had picked up the virus from rodents imported from ghana.most people recover within a few weeks. the congo basin strain kills up to 10% of those infected, but the current outbreak appears to only involve the west african strain, which in past outbreaks had a fatality rate of about 1%. outbreaks â€œgenerally fizzle out on their own,â€� lewis notes, because many infected people simply never infect anyone else. says â€œonly a small subset of the population are currently affected and while i would not be surprised if there are more cases, we donâ€™t expect it to be taking off the way covid-19, for example, took off,â€� says agam rao, a scientist in the poxvirus and rabies branch of the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), which confirmed the first u.s. case.monkeypox usually spreads through close contact and respiratory droplets, but in 2017 nigerian researchers suggested sexual transmission might have occurred in several patients with genital ulcers. those are being seen now as well, says fernando simã³n, who directs the spanish ministry of healthâ€™s coordination center for health alerts and emergencies. among the first confirmed reported cases, â€œmost have lesions exclusively perigenital, perianal, and around the mouth,â€� simã³n says. some of the first cases detected in spain are msm or transgender people who had attended a sauna in madrid or a gay pride festival in the canary islands. in belgium, several cases were linked to a gay festival in antwerp. no studies have ever found that semen can transmit the virus. â€œso far, the most acceptable hypothesis is that it is transmitted after contact with lesions,â€� simã³n says. msm and transgender communities have a high prevalence of hiv, but thereâ€™s no evidence that compromised immune systems have played any role in this outbreak. health officials in many affected countries have, for privacy reasons, offered few details about the infected people, but simã³n notes that two of the early cases detected in spain were people living with hiv infections that were well controlled with medication.scabs cover the skin lesions developed by a child and an adult who contracted monkeypox in the united states in 2003.cdc/getty imagespublic health officials face a tricky balance as they seek to clearly communicate the risks to the msm community while avoiding stigmatization. â€œstigma and blame undermine trust and capacity to respond effectively during outbreaks like this one,â€� matthew kavanagh, deputy executive director of the joint united nations programme on hiv/aids, said in a statement this week.researchers have begun to sequence viral samples, which can help trace how the virus has spread and reveal mutations that might make it more pathogenic or more transmissible. itâ€™s a laborious job: with more than 200,000 base pairs, the monkeypox genome is about seven times the size of sars-cov-2â€™s and more than 20 times larger than hivâ€™s. the first full genome, posted on 19 may by a portuguese team led gomes, showed that the strain most closely resembles viruses carried by travelers from nigeria to singapore, israel, and the united kingdom in 2018 and 2019. sequences posted by the cdc and scientists in belgium and germany support that conclusion. â€œweâ€™re not seeing any evidence that this virus has changed to become more efficiently transmitted person to person,â€� jennifer mcquiston, the head of cdcâ€™s pox virus and rabies branch, said at a 23 may press conference.because itâ€™s a dna virus, monkeypox has far better genetic repair mechanisms than rna viruses such as hiv and sars-cov-2, which means it changes more slowly. still, studies by gustavo palacios, a virologist at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai and co-workers suggest mutations are frequent enough for investigators to create virus family trees that can help clarify how cases connect to each other.monkeypox's cousin, smallpox, was a major scourge for centuries that killed up to 30% of those infected. a massive global campaign in the 1960s and â€™70s brought transmission to a halt; today, the virus is the only human pathogen to have been eradicated, although samples still exist at laboratories in russia and the united states. as cases plummeted in the early â€™70s, countries began to stop using the smallpox vaccine because its risks outweighed potential benefits. the vaccine contained a virus called vaccinia, which has a confusing history but appears to be a natural pox virus that was cultured in labs. vaccinia replicates inside the recipient and sometimes caused severe side effects, killing one in 1 million vaccinated people. whoâ€™s vaccination campaign ended in 1977, the last year a natural case of smallpox occurred.smallpox infections and the smallpox vaccine both protect against monkeypox, so an increasing number of people have become vulnerable to monkeypox over the past 50 years. some researchers have worried that monkeypox might evolve to fill the â€œecological nicheâ€� left behind by smallpox. indeed, reported cases have steadily increased africa over the yearsâ€and the new outbreak is the first one to take place on several continents simultaneously.the strategy to contain monkeypox outbreaks has always relied on educating people and finding cases early to reduce the chance they transmit the virus. but vaccines, which prevent disease even if used up to 4 days after a person is exposed to the virus, could also be used.two vaccines are licensed by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda). one, manufactured by emergent biosolutions, is similar to the smallpox vaccine used during the eradication campaign and can still cause severe disease and even death in people who have compromised immune systems. it only requires a single dose. the other, from bavarian nordic, uses a nonreplicating form of vaccinia, specifically designed to cause fewer side effects. it requires two doses given 4 weeks apart. animal studies suggest the first dose works more quickly than the vaccine from emergent biosolutions, whereas the second dose increases the durability of protection. fda has explicitly approved the bavarian nordic vaccine for both smallpox and monkeypox. the united kingdom is already offering vaccines to health care workers and other contacts of known casesâ€a strategy called ring vaccination, which was key to the success of the smallpox eradication campaign. the united states has begun to offer vaccination to some contacts but is undecided about health care workers caring for monkeypox patients. rimoin says ring vaccination doesnâ€™t seem warranted yet but that might change â€œif in the next couple of days â€¦ we see that there are hundreds and hundreds of cases.â€�both vaccines are in short supply, however. in a bizarre coincidence, bavarian nordic held a meeting with heymann and nine other public health leaders from around the world last week, planned 6 months ago, to discuss the need for more countries to stockpile its vaccine, given the increase in monkeypox cases over the past few years. â€œwe were really thinking that experts in this field and authorities need to start to reflect on it,â€� says bernard hoet, the companyâ€™s vice president of medical strategy. â€œa company like ours cannot stockpile for all the countries forever. today we have some doses available and we are going to distribute them, but how do you want us to decide if they go here or there?â€�drugs exist as well. one, tecovirimat, in 2018 became the first ever approved by fda to treat smallpox after it proved safe in human trials and effective in animals given closely related viruses. fda approved a second drug for smallpox, brincidofovir, in 2021. although neither has been approved for monkeypox, both showed promising results against the virus in animal studies.but a report published on 24 may in the lancet infectious diseases reported no evidence that brincidofovir had â€œany convincing clinical benefitâ€� in three patients treated in the united kingdom over the past 3 years and said the drug had serious toxicities. tecovirimat, in contrast, did not cause side effects and appeared to lead to a decrease in viral levels and a speedier recovery.how far and fast the virus spreads in the coming days will determine how aggressively clinicians put these tools to the test. â€œthese are very early days,â€� rimoin says.
