in early february, when war clouds were gathering over ukraine, a more personal darkness descended on yuliia kosminska. her 11-month-old daughter, alyona, tripped at their homeâ€â€œjust a small fall, but she wasnâ€™t feeling well,â€� says kosminska, a thin-film physicist at sumy state university in the countryâ€™s northeast. tests soon revealed an aggressive form of leukemia, and alyona was transferred to a pediatric cancer clinic in kyiv. â€œit was all very quick,â€� she says, her voice catching. on 24 februaryâ€the very day the russians invadedâ€she got a call with the news she was dreading: alyona had succumbed to her illness.work was a salve for her grief, but it was unsafe to return to sumy. â€œwe found ourselves far from home with almost nothing,â€� kosminska says. she found a glimmer of hope through an emergency aid program run by the wolfgang pauli institute (wpi), a math and physics research center in austria. the program gives scientists in ukraine â‚¬2000 and ph.d. students â‚¬1500â€no strings attachedâ€to sustain their lives and work. kosminska, one of the first 26 recipients, used some of the money to buy a laptop to prepare an online course on nanomaterials. â€œyou must understand,â€� she says, â€œi have to do something.â€�labs around the world have offered succor to hundreds of ukrainian scholars who have fled their war-torn country. far less aid is available for those who, by choice or necessity, have remained. many have seen their salary payments reduced or stopped as institutes divert resources to the nationâ€™s defense; some have had to flee their homes. they had no one to turn toâ€until wpi and a handful of other outfits started to toss lifelines. the sums are small; wpiâ€™s initial budget is just â‚¬50,000. but the initiatives â€œare of crucial importance for saving basic and applied science in ukraine,â€� says anatoliy zagorodny, president of the national academy of sciences of ukraine (nasu). such efforts could help stanch a brain drain that many fear will leave ukraine depleted long after the war. â€œwe understand that many of these refugees will not return,â€� says sergiy ryabchenko of the institute of physics.grander rescue packages await ukraine after the war ends. the u.s. government has begun to discuss the broad contours of a marshall plan, reminiscent of the massive u.s. effort to rebuild europe after world war ii. science will not be left out, says kenneth myers, president of crdf global, a u.s. nonprofit that runs science assistance programs in former soviet union nations. â€œthe idea is to not just bring them back to preinvasion levels, but to invest in areas where they can leapfrog and become leaders in science,â€� myers says.for now, the focus is survival. scientists marooned in conflict areas are most at risk, zagorodny says. with russian troops massing for a renewed assault on eastern ukraine, nasu intends to steer â‚¬20,000 in aid from the french academy of sciences to researchers in eastern science strongholds like kharkiv and sumy.wpiâ€™s project is already keeping 17 scientists in those cities afloat. ihor shpetnyy, an experimental physicist at sumy state, stayed behind when fellow residents evacuated. â€œmy task was to find and buy medicine for my parents,â€� he says. his motherâ€™s treatment for pulmonary hypertension costs â‚¬500 per month. with his salary halved to â‚¬220 per month, he says, the wpi money was a lifesaver.a wpi grant was a career saver for mykhaylo mykhaylov. at the end of last year, the solid state physicist had just finished renovating his lab at the verkin institute for low temperature physics and engineering in kharkiv. barely 2 months later, with kharkiv under siege, mykhaylov escorted his wife and 10-year-old son on a 6-day journey to uzhhorod, on the border with slovakia. he had to say goodbye, because most men under age 60 are barred from leaving ukraine in anticipation of being called to fight. â€œwe visited a notary, and i made a will. then i gave my wife all our savings,â€� he says.mykhaylovâ€™s family reached a haven in the netherlands. he returned home to an apartment wrecked by shelling with â‚¬300 in his pocket. â€œi was considering quitting research,â€� he says. a wpi grant gave him the wherewithal to rent an apartment outside kharkivâ€and stick with science. shelling blew out his instituteâ€™s windows; he doesnâ€™t know how his lab fared as itâ€™s too risky to visit. for now, heâ€™s writing up a research paper and â€œeager to return to experimental work, once normality is restored.â€�other organizations are joining the rescue effort. the foundation for polish science will fund at least six social science collaborations between scientists in poland and ukraine this year; each team will receive â‚¬58,000 over 1 year for salaries and research expenses. and the krzysztof skubiszewski foundation, also in poland, plans to disburse at least â‚¬240,000 to scholars in ukraine and refugees in poland, with most of it going to those in ukraine. the french academy of sciences is seeking funds for nasu from french foundations, and austriaâ€™s science ministry just contributed â‚¬50,000 to wpi, which will enable it to support another two dozen or so researchers.the sooner the war ends, the sooner ukraine can shift from science survival to revival. â€œthe diplomatic spadework is already happening,â€� says tom callahan, vice president for strategy and innovation at crdf global. one key asset that zagorodny wants to restore is a neutron source at the kharkiv institute of physics and technology that was damaged in a rocket attack last month. â€œas for our ambitious wishes to receive the latest equipment,â€� he says, â€œwe will talk about this after our victory.â€�first ukraine must endure whatever russia has in store in the east. in kharkiv and sumy, frequent air-raid sirens shatter daily rhythms. â€œthe russians can come back at any time,â€� says kosminska, who returned to sumy with her husband in early april to bury alyona. teaching and planning for future experiments help her cope, as does commiserating with friends and colleagues who have also borne hardship and loss. â€œi can say, for now, iâ€™m ok,â€� she says.
