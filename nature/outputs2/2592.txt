the iconic koala is now endangered in parts of australia, the government announced last week. the status of the marsupial was changed from threatened, on the advice of an expert panel that blamed dwindling numbers on habitat loss from land clearing and bush fires, droughts and heat waves, and disease. koala populations have declined by 50% to 60% in eastern australia since 2001, environmental organizations estimate. the endangered listing triggers greater protection of habitats, and the government promised to adopt a national recovery plan. last month, it announced it will spend $36 million over 4 years to support conservation. scientists say saving the koala will depend on quickly implementing these and other countermeasures. meanwhile, a federal court in the united states last week struck down a decision by former president donald trumpâ€™s administration to remove gray wolves from the endangered species list in much of the country outside of the rockies and yellowstone national park. the ruling restores protection from hunting.for the first time in more than 1 year, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) is set to have a permanent head. on 15 february, the senate confirmed robert califf, a cardiologist with close ties to the drug industry, as commissioner. the 50-46 vote was unusually close, with four democrats and independent senator bernie sanders (vt) opposing califf, whom president joe biden nominated in november 2021. the vote returns califfâ€a longtime clinical research leader at duke university who has recently been senior adviser for google healthâ€to a job he held under former president barack obama in 2016 and early 2017. dissenting democrats protested califfâ€™s ties to drugmakers and fdaâ€™s approval of five new prescription opioids during that tenure. abortion opponents protested califfâ€™s role in fdaâ€™s easing of access to medical abortion pills in 2016. six republicans voted in favor of califf, assuring his confirmation.the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) last week gave emergency use authorization to a monoclonal antibody that in test-tube studies neutralizes the sars-cov-2 omicron variant and its â€œsubvariantâ€� ba.2. the monoclonal, bebtelovimab, made by eli lilly and company, can be used in people at least 12 years old who have mild to moderate covid-19 and are at high risk of progressing to severe disease. in january, fda revoked emergency use authorizations for two other monoclonal treatmentsâ€one made by eli lilly, the other by regeneron pharmaceuticalsâ€that did not neutralize omicron. sotrovimab, another monoclonal authorized before omicron appeared, appears to have â€œsufficientâ€� activity against it and ba.2, according to studies briefly described in press releases by its makers, vir biotechnology and glaxosmithkline. but a preprint report, posted on biorxiv on 9 february, suggested ba.2 had â€œmarked resistanceâ€� to sotrovimab in lab studies. in addition to the monoclonals, three antiviral drugs widely used for months to treat covid-19 are also effective against omicron, their makers say.luc montagnier, who won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his role in discovering hiv, died last week at age 89. after receiving the award, he later lost the respect of many colleagues for embracing unscientific theories about cofactors he claimed were needed for the virus to cause aids, waterâ€™s ability to hold memory, and the dangers of covid-19 vaccines. in a landmark science paper in 1983, montagnierâ€™s pasteur institute lab reported the first isolation of a novel retrovirus from an aids patient. but it wasnâ€™t until 1 year later that robert galloâ€™s group at the u.s. national cancer institute conclusively proved the virus caused the disease. this led to a blood test and a prolonged, impassioned, high-profile patent battle between montagnier, gallo, and the french and u.s. governments. a 1987 settlement described the two scientists as â€œco-discoverersâ€� of the virus, but gallo did not share the nobel, awarded in 2008.rising nighttime temperatures around the globe are helping fuel more intense and long-lasting wildfires, researchers report. wildfire fighters have often relied on cooler temperatures and higher humidity at night to help calm blazes. but detailed satellite observations of fires stretching back 2 decades, paired with 4 decades of hour-by-hour weather data, have revealed a change. in fire-prone ecosystems around the world, the number of nights during which atmospheric conditions would encourage fires to keep burning has increased by 15% since 1979. that added five more nights per year on average when blazes are unlikely to be snuffed by cooler, more humid weather. in some regions, the effect was greater: in the western united states, the increase was 45% since 1979â€the equivalent of 11 additional fire-friendly nights. the research team said the changes may be associated with climate change but did not document a causal link. but, â€œthe â€˜night brakesâ€™ on fires are failing,â€� they write in this weekâ€™s issue of nature.spacexâ€™s starlink project to ring the globe with thousands of internet satellites was buffeted this month by natural and institutional forces. a 3 february launch that put 49 satellites into orbit ( joining 1800 already lofted starlinks) suffered a blow the next day when a blast of particles from a solar storm swelled earthâ€™s atmosphere, dragging as many as 40 of the satellites to a fiery death on reentry. then last week, nasa and the u.s. national science foundation (nsf) sent letters to the federal communications commission about spacexâ€™s proposal to expand its approved constellation of 12,000 starlinks by another 30,000. nasa cited concerns about collision hazards, interference with earth-observation satellites and space telescopes, and a reduced number of launch windows for rockets. nasa does not oppose the expanded fleet but says coordination will be required to protect assets from damage. nsf noted the work spacex has already done to lessen impacts on radio and optical observatories but says such efforts will be â€œeven more criticalâ€� for larger constellations.a federal judge last week prevented president joe bidenâ€™s administration from increasing its estimate of how much carbon pollution costs society. federal agencies use that number to evaluate the costs and benefits of new regulations, particularly in the energy sector; the figure is called the social cost of carbon because it factors in costs, such as declines in health outcomes and agricultural productivity, that are not reflected in market prices. the administration plans to raise the estimate of this cost from about $7 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions to $51 per ton. but u.s. district judge james cain of the western district of louisiana sided with republican attorneys general in ruling that the higher cost would harm states that produce fossil fuels, and that the administration had overstepped its authority. environmental advocates say the ruling, if upheld, would make it harder to tighten limits on greenhouse gas emissions.nasa last week released the first images taken by its flagship james webb space telescope. although unspectacular, they mark an initial step in tuning the instrumentâ€™s segmented mirror to observe the earliest galaxies and nearby exoplanets. one composite image showed 18 blurry dotsâ€all the same starâ€taken by each of the mirrorâ€™s 18 segments. in the coming weeks, engineers will adjust the alignment and curvature of the segments to create a single reflecting surface and focus those scattered dots into a single pinpoint of light.the u.s. trade representativeâ€™s office filed a complaint against mexico last week for failing to protect the vaquita, a critically endangered porpoise. it is the first complaint under the trade agreement between the two countries and canada that took effect in 2020; the pact includes stronger environmental regulations than its predecessor. if the dispute is not resolved, the united states could impose trade sanctions. until july 2021, the mexican government had prohibited fishing in a part of the gulf of california that harbors the roughly 10 vaquitas that are the last survivors of their species. but that month, mexico changed its policies to allow up to 60 boats to fish there at once. the vaquita population has dropped drastically because of entanglements in illegal fishing nets used to catch an endangered fish, the totoaba, whose swim bladder is considered a delicacy and is used medicinally in china.few people worldwide receive treatment for major depressive disorder, particularly in low and lower middle income countries, a meta-analysis shows. only 8% of patients living in poorer countries were treated, versus 33% in wealthy countries, researchers report this week in plos medicine. their analysis covered 149 studies conducted in 84 countries. major depressive disorder is defined as a persistent loss of pleasure or interest in activities for 2 weeks or longer; symptoms can range from mild to severe. globally, about 5% of adults suffer from it, with an associated economic loss estimated at $1 trillion per year, according to a report by the lancetâ€world psychiatric association commission on depression published this week. â€œthere is arguably no other health condition which is as common, as burdensome, as universal, or as treatable as depression, yet it receives little policy attention and resources,â€� said commission co-chair christian kieling of the federal university of rio grande do sul. the commissionâ€™s recommendations include folding treatment for depression into routine health care.the u.s. army wants to step up its attack on a pervasive, global adversary: climate change. the military branchâ€™s first ever climate strategy, released last week, outlines an ambitious plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from one of the worldâ€™s largest energy users, while also preparing to fight on battlefields transformed by global warming. goals include starting a large-scale shift to electric vehicles in 2027, achieving net-zero emissions from army installations by 2045, and boosting the number of soldiers and civilian employees with advanced credentials on climate change topics. the plan also calls for incorporating the latest climate science into decisions such as where to build bases and position forces. the army put no price tag on its plan, but said setting clear goals is a necessary first step toward realizing them.
