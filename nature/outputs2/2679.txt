rabbits and their relatives tend to be homebodies, rarely straying more than a few kilometers from their warrens. but one hare living in canada’s high arctic has defied those expectations, hopping hundreds of kilometers from its home to one of the country’s northernmost lakes.to find out where—and how far—arctic hares (lepus arcticus) travel, wildlife biologists in 2019 tagged 25 of them living on ellesmere island, near northern greenland. over the ensuing few months, most traveled more than 100 kilometers toward lake hazen, an oasis on the island with warmer weather and more plants than the surrounding arctic desert. but one of the hares journeyed a record-breaking 388 kilometers—the longest known journey of any lagomorph, a group of animals that includes rabbits, hares, and pika—researchers reported last month in ecology. the intrepid hare not only made it to the lake, but hopped well beyond the water and later doubled back. nineteen of her companions also made it to lake hazen, but didn’t venture farther.researchers don’t know for sure why the hares have such wanderlust, but they suspect the mammals are migrating en masse in search of food. hares play key roles in the arctic ecosystem, munching on local plants before being munched on themselves by arctic wolves, arctic foxes, gulls, and snowy owls. the bounty of the lake must be impressive to outweigh the challenges such a long journey poses for such small animals, the researchers say. the discovery drives home how little researchers know about these far-ranging travelers, they add, and it goes to show they can go the distance if they need to.
