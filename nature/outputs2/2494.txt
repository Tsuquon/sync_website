for more than 450 years, norse settlers from scandinavia livedâ€sometimes even thrivedâ€in southern greenland. then, they vanished. their mysterious disappearance in the 14th century has been linked to everything from plummeting temperatures and poor land management to plague and pirate raids. now, researchers have discovered an additional factor that might have helped seal the settlersâ€™ fate: drought.the vikings raided, traded, and eventually formed norse settlements throughout northwestern europe, including in iceland. according to icelandic legend, an explorer named erik the red then sailed west around 985 c.e. and established two settlements in southern greenland. at its peak, about 3000 norse farmers raised cattle, sheep, and goats on the island.in the new study, boyang zhao, a paleoclimatologist at the university of massachusetts, amherst, and colleagues analyzed mud from the bottom of a lake in southern greenland for clues about the climate norse settlers experienced during their time there, between about 985 and 1450 c.e. the lake lies within one of the two settlements (the eastern settlement), near a cluster of stone ruins that were once norse homes and cow sheds.last year, the team showed the biochemistry of bacteria in the lake changes in response to temperature. for the new study, they extracted the remains of long-dead microbes from the layers of mud on the lake bed, which they dated with radiocarbon. by tracking changes in bacterial chemistry through time, they reconstructed past temperatures.although temperatures fluctuated during the period of norse occupation, the researchers found no long-term cooling trend. â€œwhen i saw those temperature records i got pretty surprised,â€� zhao says, considering the widely held view that falling temperatures made tending livestock challenging and contributed to the demise of the settlement.the data on water availability told a different story. to examine this feature, the team looked at hydrogen isotopes in the remains of plants buried in the lake mud. when plants lose water to evaporation in dry weather, their leaves become enriched in a heavy hydrogen isotope, deuterium. by measuring the deuterium content of leaf remains from layers in the lake mud, the researchers found that southern greenlandâ€™s climate became progressively drier during the norse period, as they report today in science advances. with droughts more common, the norse would have been unable to grow enough grass to keep their livestock from starving during the long, cold winters, zhao says.itâ€™s certainly believable that the norse had to deal with drought, says thomas mcgovern, an archaeologist at hunter college. excavations at norse farms have uncovered evidence of irrigation channels to capture water and spread it over a wide area, he notes.modern farmers in greenland also deal with water shortages, says zhao, who talked to locals while in the field. â€œi asked them: whatâ€™s the most important challenge for you today? they said if they donâ€™t get enough rain in the summer they donâ€™t get enough grass to feed their animals.â€�several severe droughts have struck greenland in recent years. â€œaround 2015 it was very dryâ€we had rain in june and then the next came in august,â€� says elna jensen, who farms land near narsaq, greenland, close to the lake zhaoâ€™s team studied.but norse and modern farming are different, cautions christian madsen, deputy director of the greenland national museum and archives. for instance, many modern farmers have drained and fertilized their land to improve productivity, but this leaves the land more vulnerable to the effects of drought.itâ€™s also important to appreciate that the norse did attempt to adapt to the changing environment on greenland, mcgovern says. archaeological evidence shows they began to consume more marine food, including seal meat, as farming became harder.they vanished anyway, and mcgovern argues social factors may have played a key role, too. the norse undertook long and dangerous voyages to the waters off northwest greenland where they hunted walruses for ivory to sell on the european market. ivory was a source of wealth and power for local elites, but by taking a chunk of the working population away from food production as conditions deteriorated, walrus hunting may have helped doom the settlement.â€œwe can see with 20:20 hindsight potentially how they could have survived in some way, but they didnâ€™t,â€� mcgovern says. â€œthis was a society that chose to fail in some respects.â€�
