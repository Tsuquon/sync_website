in a subtropical wetland in what is now spain, a 5-ton dinosaur with a limp walked in shallow waters surrounded by grazing fish. scientists uncovered this moment in prehistoric time from just six preserved footprints the animal left behind in the limestone of an ancient fossil bed east of madrid, some 129 million years ago.when paleontologists started to study the peculiar footprints in the la huérguina formation 6 years ago, they knew their age and they knew a dinosaur made them. but they weren’t sure the same animal made all of them: the left and right footprints showed different lengths, as if a toe was missing in the left foot. poor preservation could also explain the disparity. to find the real answer, the researchers used a special 3d scanner to obtain detailed measurements—depth, width, and length—of each footprint. they then compared them with another 75 sets of dinosaur footprints from around the world.the tracks of the right foot clearly show three toes, but the tracks of the left foot show only short and irregular impressions where the innermost toe should be (see image, above). whereas fossilized dinosaur trackways are usually narrow, with long strides, the trackway the researchers studied reveals a wide stance—about 45 centimeters apart—with shorter strides and a greater load on the right foot, possibly compensating for an injured left foot. but the impressions are consistent enough that they must belong to the same animal, the team reports today in plos one. the researchers estimate the dinosaur was walking at a speed of 4 kilometers per hour, and it was 6 to 7 meters long—the first record of such a large dinosaur in the las hoyas site.the researchers think the dinosaur, species unknown, had a dislocated toe pointed backward. it may have suffered an injury—or it could’ve been an ancient version of crooked toes, foot deformities that modern birds have, usually in their innermost toes like the dino, because of genetic factors or a poor diet.
