since 2019, anna abalkina has been monitoring a website that offers an illicit way for scientists to burnish their cvs. the site, operated from russia, openly offers to sell authorship slots on soon-to-be-published scientific papers, for fees ranging from several hundred dollars to nearly $5000. abalkina, a sociologist at the free university of berlin, has documented what appears to be a flourishing business on the site, www.123mi.ru. since it debuted in december 2018, she has analyzed more than 1000 advertisements posted there and found at least 419 that appeared to match manuscripts that later appeared in dozens of different journals, she reported in a preprint posted on arxiv in march.more than 100 of these identified papers were published in 68 journals run by established publishers, including elsevier, oxford university press, springer nature, taylor & francis, wolters kluwer, and wiley-blackwell, although most of these were specialized publications. russian authors outnumbered any other nationality on the websiteâ€™s tally of recent contracts.run by international publisher llc, the site is one of many illicit â€œpaper millsâ€� that leaders in scientific publishing worry are increasingly corrupting the literature by selling bogus authorship or prewritten papers. but its scale and brazenness are unusual, as are the insights abalkina has gleaned into its workings. her findings are â€œfascinating,â€� says elisabeth bik, an independent science integrity expert in san francisco who believes they reflect fallout from russiaâ€™s 2012 decision to set policies tying researchersâ€™ promotions and financial rewards to their volume of scholarly publications. â€œit is another example of what can go wrong in scientific publishing if the pressure to publish is increased,â€� says bik, who has studied paper mills based in china. to lure prospective customers, the advertisements on www.123mi.ru provide tantalizing details about each paper, which it claims are already accepted for publication. they include its topic, the number of authors, and sometimes its abstract. the advertisements also provide hints about the prestige and impact of the journal in which the paper will appear, including whether it is indexed in the scopus and web of science databases.prices for authorship slots vary depending on their position in the authors list and the impact factor of the journal, abalkina found. costs have varied from about 15,000 rubles ($175) to 410,000 rubles ($4800), with first author slots usually the most expensive. based on these fees, abalkina estimates that from 2019 to 2021, international publisher raked in about $6.5 million. (the website does not specify how much its customers actually paid.) to keep the deals hush-hush, the contract includes a confidentiality clause.the advertisements withhold the name of the journal, which the purchaser is told only after paying the fee. abalkinaâ€™s paper quotes claims by the website that it has split its fees with some unidentified journals to ensure their participation in the scheme.several of the largest publishers of journals identified in abalkinaâ€™s studyâ€oxford university press, springer nature, taylor & francis, and wiley-blackwellâ€say they are examining papers identified by abalkina that she brought to their attention. elsevier has procedures to detect authorship changes after a manuscript is submitted, which editors must approve, a spokesperson said. as for the papers identified by abalkina, â€œthere were few indications of authorship changes occurring after submission.â€�chris graf, director of research integrity at springer nature, declined to discuss specifics but called paper mills â€œbad for both the research and the publishing communities. alongside investigating individual cases and retracting compromised papers, weâ€™ve been reviewing our processes and making investments in technologies to help us identify attempts to manipulate our systems.â€�science contacted international publisherâ€which says it is headquartered in moscow and has offices in ukraine, kazakhstan, and iranâ€for comment multiple times by email, phone, and whatsapp but received no response. its chief editor, according to her linkedin page, is ukraine-based philologist ksenia badziun, who says she graduated from taras shevchenko national university of kyiv. the company has continued to operate during russiaâ€™s invasion of ukraine. science also contacted 20 corresponding authors of papers identified by abalkina; most did not respond. one, who asked not to be named, said he knows nothing about international publisher or its activities and that all listed co-authors contributed to the work.kim-hung pho, a statistician at ton duc thang university who co-authored two of the flagged studiesâ€both published by digital scholarship in the humanities, run by oxford university pressâ€also told science he has no knowledge of www.123mi.ru. â€œi donâ€™t have any funds to do scientific research, so i have absolutely no money to buy [authorship in] these articles, and there is no pressure to do this.â€�in 2021, publishers retracted a record 724 articles traced to paper mills, part of a grand total of more than 1000 such articles retracted during the past decade, according to a database maintained by the retraction watch website. (more than 4 million scholarly papers are now published annually.)at least two nonprofit groups that advocate for honest practices in publishing have issued guidance to journal editors about how to deter purchased authorships. the committee on publication ethics and the international committee of medical journal editors recommend that editors require authors who request to add an author after submitting a manuscript to provide an explanation and signed permission from all other listed authors.but some observers suggest journal editors should do more. if they discover papers with authors who paid to be listed, they should flag them by attaching a written â€œexpression of concernâ€� because â€œany association with the mill raises some question about the integrity of the paper,â€� says bryan victor, who studies social work at wayne state university. in december 2021, he co-authored a separate analysis of www.123mi.ru on retraction watch, which described nearly 200 papers that may match authorships advertised there; subsequently, he and a colleague posted a catalog of contracts displayed on the site, which together refer to about 1500 articles.whether editors could have identified fraudulent authors before publication remains murky. but the papers do offer clues, abalkina found. for example, a few list authors in multiple unrelated academic departments, making it unlikely they collaborated. in other cases, the authorsâ€™ specialties donâ€™t match the manuscriptâ€™s title.but to avoid scrutiny from editors, international publisher appears to follow a strategy of not repeatedly targeting the same journals, abalkina says. â€œthat makes it impossible for an editor to detect some anomalies,â€� she says.
