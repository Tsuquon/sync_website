in may 2020, with anonymous callers vowing to kill him and similar threats mounting on social media, rick bright gave up his cellphone and went into hiding for more than a month. â€œif i heard tires rolling over the road in the middle of the night in the driveway where i was staying, it was panic,â€� says the 55-year-old immunologist, who until that month had been a powerful, if obscure, u.s. government public health official.the threats began after bright filed a whistleblower suit alleging he had been demoted from the top job at the biomedical advanced research and development authority (barda) for protesting the governmentâ€™s covid-19 contracts and what he saw as its misguided, plodding response to the growing pandemic. he accused his bosses of trying to steer taxpayer dollars to firms run by â€œcroniesâ€� or â€œfor political purposes.â€� the â€œstraw that broke the camelâ€™s back,â€� the complaint stated, is that he publicly criticized hydroxychloroquineâ€the antimalaria drug then-president donald trump had touted as a coronavirus remedyâ€as useless.the suit and his congressional testimony that soon followed catapulted bright into the public eye. a 60 minutes story described him as â€œthe highest ranking government scientist to charge the federal governmentâ€™s response to the coronavirus pandemic has been slow and chaotic.â€� trump took to twitter to assail him, but many of brightâ€™s peers in public health cheered him. â€œhe was one of the very early people to tell the american people what was going on,â€� says nicole lurie, who during former president barack obamaâ€™s administration oversaw barda as assistant secretary for preparedness and response (aspr) at the department of health and human services (hhs). â€œhe had a lot of guts.â€�brightâ€™s abrupt, tumultuous exit from barda, where he had for 4 years overseen a $1 billionâ€plus research budget aimed at protecting the country from pandemics and bioweapons, marked but one more dramatic chapter in a rough-and-tumble life. now, in a bold gamble on his ability to make something from nothing, the rockefeller foundation has hired bright to head a new bid to protect the world from future pandemics.rockefeller will give the pandemic prevention institute (ppi) $150 million in seed money over the next 3 years to tap and quickly share pathogen surveillance data gathered by myriad sources. â€œweâ€™re setting out to build an environment for sharing data around the world at all levelsâ€not just governmentsâ€that will allow us to make smarter decisions,â€� bright says.â€œiâ€™m wildly supportive that the rockefellerâ€™s doing this,â€� says eric lander, director of the white houseâ€™s office of science and technology policy, which recently issued its own ambitious, multibillion-dollar prescription to better address pandemics. rajiv shah, rockefellerâ€™s president, is certain bright can turn ppi into a powerful force. â€œrick is absolutely the best person on the planet to lead it,â€� shah says. bruce gellin, an epidemiologist who for 15 years led hhsâ€™s national vaccine program office and is one of ppiâ€™s first 16 employees, says, â€œrick is a 50-year-vision person. thatâ€™s what he does.â€�but even some admirers wonder how brightâ€™s new venture will stand out among efforts by governments, academia, industry, and the world health organization (who) that share ppiâ€™s elusive aspiration, including several new ones with similarly large backing. and his detractors charge that bright can be arrogant. â€œhis ego is bigger than his managerial skills,â€� says physician robert kadlec, lurieâ€™s successor as aspr under trump and the main target of brightâ€™s blistering whistleblower complaint.lurie sees it differently. bright, she says, has no fear of speaking what he perceives as truth to power. â€œeven when it was unpopular, it was something he did, whether it was about programmatic stuff or individuals,â€� she says. â€œif rick didnâ€™t respect somebody, it was difficult for him to play along without saying something.â€�brightâ€™s hardscrabble roots help explain his willingness to speak out, lurie says. â€œwhen you overcome a huge amount of adversity, it builds a new kind of self-confidence and resilience.â€� but little else foreshadowed that bright would become a leader in vaccine development and pandemic preparedness. nearly 40 years ago, his high school in hutchinson, kansas, told him he could not attend his senior year because he had not received the vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella. turns out, he says, â€œmy mother never vaccinated us for anything.â€�bright, who bounced between eight foster homes after his family fell apart because of an abusive stepfather, stresses that his mother wasnâ€™t antivaccine. â€œwe were a low-income family in a small town,â€� says bright, who has six siblings. â€œit was an educational thing.â€�he got vaccinated and finished high schoolâ€a notable feat given his background. â€œmy choice in life growing up was to drop out of school early and take over the auto salvage business or work on the farm,â€� he says. college, he adds, never would have occurred to him, but while in high school he worked 40 hours a week at a restaurant owned by a family that valued education and encouraged him to keep studying. he enrolled at the university of kansas as an accounting major, his ticket out of hutchinson. but he soon dropped out and moved to kansas city, missouri, with no concrete plans.a help wanted ad in the paper led to a job at a dance studio, cold calling potential clients. during a coffee break, one of the studioâ€™s teachersâ€a â€œglamorous woman with a glamorous lifeâ€�â€asked him whether he had any interest in becoming an instructor. after 1 month of dance lessons, he had his first career. a wealthy studentâ€an elderly woman who had lost a son his age the year beforeâ€took a shine to him and challenged him to restart his college education. she offered him $10,000 to quit his job, and he accepted. â€œi went back for a year and dropped out again, still lost.â€�bright became seriously interested in science when a lab that did diagnostic testing hired him to write educational material. he decided to try college again, moving to alabama with the dream of going to medical school. to be eligible for in-state tuition, he needed to live there for 1 year, so he took a job at blockbuster video, which helped him pay off $25,000 in credit card debt. he eventually enrolled at auburn university, paying his way through school by washing glassware in a lab. bright was 30 years old in 1997 when he graduated, magna cum laude, with a double major in biology and chemistry.for his ph.d., bright attended emory university, where he told his adviser, hiv vaccine researcher harriet robinson, he wanted to do something unique. he was thrilled when she let him focus on developing a vaccine against h5n1, a highly lethal bird flu strain that had jumped to humans. â€œi want to save lives, and i want to protect people,â€� bright says. he got his first taste of research with dangerous pathogens, running experiments in high-biosecurity labs at the nearby centers for disease control and prevention (cdc).bright returned to cdc after getting his ph.d., studying the limitations of an entire class of influenza drugs and publishing first-author papers in the lancet and jama. he soon turned to influenza vaccines again, first at an up-and-coming company called novavax (which recently developed a covid-19 vaccine) and then at path, a nonprofit that focuses on global health. there he helped a government-owned manufacturer in vietnam produce shots for seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza viruses.the path project received funding from barda, which lured bright in 2010 to oversee its international projects, and he soon moved into the influenza and emerging diseases division. ted ross, a postdoc in robinsonâ€™s lab while bright was doing his ph.d. who now develops influenza vaccines at the university of georgia, athens, soon found himself seeking money from his old friend and collaboratorâ€who sometimes turned him down. â€œhe could listen to 100 proposals and not really flinch,â€� ross says. â€œhe knew when people were kind of bs-ing him versus what was real.â€�during brightâ€™s decade at barda, he oversaw billions of dollars of investments into countermeasures against potential chemical and nuclear threats, as well as drugs and vaccines for bioweapons and infectious diseases such as pandemic influenza, middle east respiratory syndrome, zika, and then covid-19. he also helped shape the governmentâ€™s response to epidemics at home and abroad, represented the country at who, and regularly briefed congress. as bright documents in his whistleblower suit, he received â€œstellar performance appraisalsâ€� from no less than kadlec.bright says tensions with kadlec predated the pandemic. the former air force officer, he asserts, believed barda should emphasize protecting against bioweapons over emerging infectious diseases. but covid-19 made simmering bad blood boil. bright and kadlec battled about whether to fund specific masks, drugs, and vaccines to thwart sars-cov-2. discord also grew after bright visited the white house at the invitation of peter navarro, a trade adviser to trump who early on advocated for more aggressive actions to stop the emerging virus. bright says he lobbied for a crash program to make covid-19 vaccinesâ€a pandemic â€œmanhattan projectâ€�â€which navarro spelled out in a memo on 9 february 2020 to the white houseâ€™s coronavirus task force. it took 2 months before hhs endorsed the concept, when it formed operation warp speed.kadlec, bright contends, was livid about the meetings with navarro, which spurred the white house to push hhs to ramp up mask production, purchase potentially helpful drugs, and invest billions in vaccine development. â€œkadlec was very uncomfortable with it,â€� bright says. â€œhe actually could see that pressure was mounting. there were jokes in the hallway about rick and his new friend, peter.â€�bright also convinced congress that to better respond to the pandemic, barda needed a substantial infusion of funding that it could controlâ€without asprâ€™s oversight. and then bright shared with a reporter concerns about what he later called in his complaint hhsâ€™s â€œreckless and dangerous pushâ€� of hydroxychloroquine and its analogs as covid-19 treatments. on 20 april 2020, kadlec transferred him from barda to the national institutes of health (nih) to oversee a new project on covid-19 diagnostics.bright recognized the importance of ramping up diagnostics, but he charged that the transfer amounted to retaliation. in his richly detailed, 63-page complaintâ€which included navarroâ€™s memo as one of 61 exhibitsâ€bright made allegations of fraud, cronyism, waste, and abuse of power within the federal covid-19 response. according to brightâ€™s lawyers, the office of special counselâ€an independent federal agency that oversees the whistleblower protection actâ€promptly concluded that brightâ€™s complaint documented a â€œsubstantial likelihood of wrongdoingâ€� and referred the matter to hhs for an investigation.on the morning of 14 may 2020, shortly before bright was set to testify at a congressional hearing, trump attacked. â€œi donâ€™t know the so-called whistleblower rick bright, never met him or even heard of him,â€� trump tweeted. â€œbut to me he is a disgruntled employee, not liked or respected by people i spoke to and who, with his attitude, should no longer be working for our government!â€�at the hearing, bright warned that the u.s. response to the pandemic had gone awry. â€œwithout better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history,â€� he said. asked about trumpâ€™s downplaying the pandemicâ€™s threat in the preceding months, bright minced his wordsâ€but the criticism was plain: â€œi believe americans need to be told the truth,â€� he said. â€œand i believe that the best scientific guidance and advice was not being conveyed to the american public during that time.â€�kadlec, who was not allowed to respond to brightâ€™s allegations while he was aspr, was outraged. â€œyou want to talk about some hurt feelings? you got it here, buddy,â€� says kadlec, who now works on the minority republican staff of the u.s. senate health committee. he acknowledges that they had different views about bardaâ€™s role from the start, but says his mandate required addressing both bioterror and infectious disease equally. kadlec says shifting bright to nih wasnâ€™t retaliation, but rather part of the war on covid-19. â€œthis is my military background. the mission was to save lives, and the immediate mission is, â€˜we need diagnosticsâ€rick, go over there.â€™â€�â€œnone of [brightâ€™s] allegations have been substantiated,â€� asserts a former hhs lawyer who helped evaluate the whistleblower complaint and asked not to be identified. many come down to what that lawyer, who was appointed by the trump administration, sees as professional judgment calls. â€œrick did not play well with others,â€� the lawyer says. â€œhe wanted to be the guy that called the shots, and he didnâ€™t want any criticism or oversight or accountability or checks on that authority.â€�after brightâ€™s congressional testimony, navarro called his former ally â€œa deserter in the war on the china virus.â€� when bright appeared on 60 minutes a few days later, trump lashed out at him again, tweeting that he â€œfabricates stories,â€� â€œspews lies,â€� and is â€œa creep.â€� bright says unknown people subsequently began to call his relatives about his personal life, trying to dig up dirt about boyfriends, even though he is openly gay. â€œit was disgusting,â€� he says.brightâ€™s fall from grace didnâ€™t last long. president-elect joe biden made him an adviser on a covid-19 transition team. in august 2021, hhs settled the whistleblower suit with bright, agreeing to back pay and damages for â€œemotional stress and reputational damage,â€� according to his lawyers. they add that hhs has a separate, ongoing investigation into his allegations about contract improprieties and inappropriate responses to the pandemic. (hhs would not confirm or deny this.) and bright is trying again to head off pandemics, this time from outside government.ppiâ€™s vast office space in washington, d.c., isnâ€™t just pandemic emptyâ€itâ€™s startup empty. as bright begins to fill its cubicles with disease modelers, global health specialists, political scientists, epidemiologists, and health economists, he recognizes that his vision for ppi also still has many blanks to fill inâ€and knows he is entering an increasingly crowded and well-funded field. with backing from germany, who will supplement its long-standing outbreak alert network with a hub in berlin to analyze the incoming data and better plan responses. cdc is similarly launching a new group to aid local u.s. officials facing a spreading pathogen. â€œno one can do it all,â€� bright says. â€œwe have to now come together to decide how we divide and conquer this ecosystem.â€�covid-19 has illustrated the many problems the world has in spotting and responding to a global outbreak of a killer pathogen. a variety of new initiatives are forming to reduce the odds that history will repeat itself.his recipeâ€building trust, collecting and sharing data, creating a reliable early warning system, and applying modern analyticsâ€is far from unique. but ppi should be able to react more quickly to gathering threats than other entities, says manisha bhinge, a health economist and computer scientist on the team. organizations like who, she says, â€œdonâ€™t have the space to be wrong or fail, so they often take a lot of time,â€� bhinge says. â€œour ability as a nonstate actor, and having some degree of independence, is to complement them and be wrong occasionally.â€�dylan george, an infectious disease modeler and a leader of cdcâ€™s new center, suggests ppi has another advantage: more freedom than government or quasi-governmental agencies like who to quickly fund projects that, say, test wastewater or scale up new diagnostics. â€œa little bit of money early in an outbreak can have an outsized impact,â€� george says.ppi now receives data from 30 partners that track diseases, including universities in several countries, the african and u.s. cdcs, large hospital systems, a livestock research institute in kenya, a genomics center in nigeria, and a molecular biology group in india. in addition to giving several of those partners a total of $20 million in grants, ppi has invested $4.5 million in a new south african center that aims to strengthen genomic surveillance of pathogens throughout that continent. â€œtoday, health care providers, labs, and health departments are the primary source of information on new disease threats,â€� says disease modeler sam scarpino, head of ppiâ€™s pathogen surveillance. â€œthis traditional approach misses large swaths of the population who do not have access to quality health care. it also means that the first signs of an outbreak are detected weeks, if not months, after the emergence.â€�the next step is to make sense of the data, bright says. â€œwhat no one has ever done is put together the new, brilliant architectural system to connect all this disparate data together and analyze it the way a hedge fund manager analyzes all sorts of different data to understand where to invest,â€� bright says. â€œyes, a lot of data are now being generated, but i liken it to severed arteries: there is just blood spurting everywhere.â€�the ultimate challenge remains translating the improved surveillance into earlier detection and better tracking. â€œafter all the billions of dollars that i have been instrumental in spending to make a better vaccine, a better drug, or a better diagnostic, iâ€™ve learned that none of that is effective if we donâ€™t have a global early warning system that is agnostic of politics, without financial pressure, without someone waiting for another government to share information, without us waiting until it gets to our borders,â€� bright says.â€œitâ€™s not just for governments and policymakers,â€� he says. â€œhow do we reach my mother with a tool that can say, â€˜itâ€™s not safe to go outside today,â€™ or â€˜i need to take extra precautions,â€™ or â€˜i need to change my behavior?â€™â€�in august 2021, brightâ€™s mother was living with a relative who tested positive for sars-cov-2. she had received two doses of a vaccine, but she was at high risk of severe covid-19, so she isolated herself at a different home. when she fell ill, bright urged her to get a coronavirus test, but her doctor said it wasnâ€™t necessary because she was vaccinated. but, he recalls, â€œshe would call and she could barely talk.â€�on 17 august, his mother died of what he is certain was covid-19. â€œiâ€™m heartbroken beyond words that this pandemic has now taken my mom,â€� bright tweeted. â€œplease get vaccinated, tested & please wear a high quality mask (over mouth & nose). iâ€™m in so much pain from losing my mother, trust me, i donâ€™t want anyone else to feel this pain.â€�
