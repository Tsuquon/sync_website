in 79 c.e., torrents of blazing rock, ash, and gas descended on pompeii, instantly turning the small but lively italian village into a soot-covered mausoleum. now, researchers have sequenced the whole genome of a man who perished in the eruption, providing new genetic insights into pompeii’s doomed populace.scientists examined the skeletons of a man and a woman who were first discovered during excavations in the 1910s. the pair was found leaning against a low couch inside a dwelling known as the house of the craftsman (pictured). the researchers located ancient dna in their petrous bones—dense inner ear bones that preserve genetic material particularly well—but only managed to successfully retrieve a complete genome from the man.the scientists compared his genome with those of hundreds of other ancient and modern people from across eurasia. he was most closely related to people living today in central italy and sardinia, they conclude today in scientific reports. his central italian ancestry is unsurprising, the authors note, but his sardinian heritage has never been seen before in the published genomes of ancient romans.within the man’s remains, the researchers also detected dna from the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis, suggesting he was infected with the respiratory disease before he died. that, too, came as little surprise, as historians and scientists have long known tuberculosis was common at the time. nonetheless, the authors say, the study paves the way for future genetic work that could offer a more complete picture of the lives of ancient pompeiians.
