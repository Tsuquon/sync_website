there are few things more spectacular—or startling—than a large flock of birds swirling overhead in a synchronized dance across the sky. now, researchers have figured out how these flyers soar so close together without crashing.the scientists focused on starlings (sturnus vulgaris), which commonly fly in large flocks. they tweaked computer models until they came up with one whose on-screen birds behaved like real birds. the challenge was to figure out how large flocks maintain certain speeds even as individuals within them go faster and slower.the secret, the team reports today in nature communications, is having marginal speed control: the birds, which fly 8 meters to 18 meters per second, readily slow down or speed up a little to keep up with birds nearby. but they refuse to change speed by a lot, which could lead to the breakup of the flock. these behaviors help ensure the animals keep up with one another but never wind up going so slow—or so fast—that flying alone or together becomes impossible.these speed checks also help explain why all starling flocks average about 12 meters per second, no matter how big, the researchers say. they note that other bird species that form flocks likely use a similar strategy, and that marginal speed control may play a role in all sorts of collective behavior in biological systems, be it the movement of bacteria, clusters of cells, insect swarms, or herds of vertebrates. the principles that guide these coordinated movements may one day help engineers come up with drones and other robots that work in synchrony, they add.
