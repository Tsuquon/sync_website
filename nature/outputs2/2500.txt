an archerfish can blast a spider out of a mangrove bush from 1 meter away, sending the prey plopping into the water where the sharpshooting swimmer quickly gobbles it up. but just how these surprisingly intelligent fish shoot jets of water with enough force to blast even juvenile lizards off their feet has long been a mystery.scientists have two competing ideas. one, the blowpipe hypothesis, maintains that bony parts of the fish’s mouth clap together into a tube shape through which the water spurts out like peas through a straw. the pressure tank hypothesis, meanwhile, claims that pressure builds up and gets released through two soft tissue valves just behind the lips, like a pressure cooker letting off steam.a study published today in integrative organismal biology comes down on the side of the blowpipe. researchers examined the mouth anatomy of the nine known archerfish species, all native to rivers and estuaries of asia and australia. in each of them, the bone that’s the fish equivalent of a tongue (the basihyal) was shaped like a shoehorn that fit neatly over a groove in the hard palate above (seen in this video based on a computerized tomography scan). to spit water, the archerfish brings its bony tongue to the roof of the mouth, compressing water at the back and forcing it out through the tube formed by the bones.the soft tissues of the mouth might still play a role, however. archerfish have surprisingly good aim, and their mouth valves may somehow help improve their accuracy.
