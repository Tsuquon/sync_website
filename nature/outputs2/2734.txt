if youâ€™re a fan of weird animals and exotic concepts, weâ€™ve got a top 10 list for you. from wombats that poop cubes to hypothetical power plants fueled by black holes, our annual end-of-the-year list includes staff favorites and some of our most popular stories of the year. you wonâ€™t find any covid-19 news here (for that, check out our breakthrough of the year). but if you want some fun in your scienceâ€and donâ€™t mind a bit of scatologyâ€read on!barnyard breakthrough: researchers successfully potty train cowsscientists in germany have achieved what many biologists (and farmers) thought impossible: theyâ€™ve toilet trained cows. the advance doesnâ€™t just give our bovine pals more cognitive creditâ€it could help put a serious dent in the toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases produced by farm animal waste.mysterious dna sequences, known as â€˜borgs,â€™ recovered from california mudin the mud of her backyard, a researcher discovered a strange linear chromosome that included genes from a variety of microbesâ€a new type of genetic material that her trekkie son proposed naming â€œborgsâ€� (after the next generation baddies). are they part of a viral genome? strange bacteria? whatever borgs are, one expert says, the find is â€œpretty exciting.â€� and who can resist a good star trek reference?scientists entered peopleâ€™s dreams and got them â€˜talkingâ€™speaking of science fiction, one story this year brought us a bit closer to the fantastical world of the movie inception, in which humans enter the dreams of others. for the first time, researchers have had â€œconversationsâ€� with people in the dream state, including getting them to answer yes-or-no questions and solve math problems. the work could help people better deal with anxiety and depression, and perhaps even gain new skillsâ€all while catching some zzzs.giant diamonds may hold the key to superdeep earthquakesletâ€™s go deep again, this time 300 kilometers below earthâ€™s surface. earthquakes shouldnâ€™t occur here, yet they commonly doâ€a phenomenon that has mystified seismologists for decades. something appears to be releasing water at these depths, weakening nearby rocks. the answer, according to this study, could be the same as what to get that special someone this holiday season: giant, fist-size diamonds.â€˜mind blowingâ€™: grizzly bear dna maps onto indigenous language familiesbears and indigenous humans of coastal british columbia have more in common than meets the eye. grizzlies in this region form three distinct genetic groups that closely align with the regionâ€™s three indigenous language families, perhaps because the bears clustered in the same regions favored by humans. one expert calls the find a â€œreally shockingâ€� observation that could reveal that the fate of humans and wildlife is even more intertwined than we thought.black holes surrounded by massive, energy-harvesting structures could power alien civilizationsanother far-out idea, this time from a galaxy far, far away. researchers have shown that highly advanced alien civilizations could theoretically build megastructures called dyson spheres around black holes to harness their energy, which can be 100,000 times that of our sun. even better for us humans, if such technology is at work, there may be a way to spot it.how do wombats poop cubes? scientists get to the bottom of the mysteryonly one animal on earth poops cubes: a furry australian marsupial known as the bare-nosed wombat. but how do they do it? researchers get to the bottom of the mystery in this scatological story. now, they just have to figure out why the animals evolved cubic poop in the first place, though it may be to keep it from rolling off high perches.this sea slug cut off its own headâ€and lived to tell the taleit was â€œlike a horror movie.â€� thatâ€™s how one scientist describes our creepiest video of the year, wherein a sea slug head wriggles around the bottom of an aquatic tank, seemingly searching for the rest of its body. rather than die, the amazing noggin regrew the rest of its anatomyâ€a feat practically unheard of in complex animals.kinky and absurd: the first ai-written play isnâ€™t shakespeareâ€but it has its momentswhen a conversation about euthanasia ends up in a fight about who has whose finger in whose anus, you know youâ€™re not in for a typical day at the theater. but thatâ€™s what happens when a robot writes your play. in one of our most surreal stories of the year, artificial intelligence attempts to tell the story of a machine that ventures out into the world. things donâ€™t go as planned, as men become women, robots take over the world, and fingers â€¦ end up where theyâ€™re not supposed to be. the play wasnâ€™t easy on the human performers either, a study author says. â€œone of the actresses told me it was the most challenging work of her career.â€�the legendary dire wolf may not have been a wolf at alldire wolves are not what they seem. the first genetic analysis of the ice age carnivores finds that they are so different from other wolves, coyotes, and dogs that they donâ€™t belong in the same genus as these animals. instead, researchers argue, they need an entirely new scientific classification. this â€œfascinatingâ€� find was also our most read nonâ€covid-19 story of the year. why so popular? maybe people like wolves. maybe they like ancient dna. or maybe there are just a ton of game of thrones fans out there.
