when comet lovejoy (pictured) streaked past earth in 2014, it sported a hazy green aura—a phenomenon also seen with other comets. now, through first-of-their-kind lab measurements, researchers have figured out the odd chemistry behind this colorful glow.scientists have long suspected the green glow around some comets comes from the breakdown of a reactive molecule called dicarbon (c2). to verify this in the lab, researchers used an ultraviolet laser to strip away the chlorine atoms from molecules of carbon chloride (c2cl4) and then bombarded the remaining c2 molecule with high-intensity light. the details of the chemical reactions they observed were somewhat surprising.rather than absorbing a single photon of light and then emitting a green one as the molecule breaks down, the reaction required the molecule to absorb two photons. one of those photons excites the c2 molecule to a semistable state, and the second one is needed to bump it up to an even more energy-rich and unstable configuration. from there, the molecule decays and radiates a characteristic green photon, the researchers report online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences.during the process, c2 undergoes two transitions that chemists typically consider forbidden. (these transitions aren’t absolutely forbidden by the laws of physics, the researchers explain; they’re merely rarely seen in the lab because molecules are closely spaced and interact in other ways first. in deep space near comets, however, molecules are widely spaced and rarely interact with other molecules or atoms.)data gathered during the team’s experiments suggest that, at earth’s distance from the sun, the lifetime of the c2 molecule is a little less than 2 days. that helps explain why the green glow associated with the breakdown of the molecule only appears around the head of the comet and never in its tail, the researchers say.
