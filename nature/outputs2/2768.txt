the votes are in! in the first week of polling, thousands of you told us which discoveries of the past year should make it to the final round of voting for scienceâ€™s 2021 peopleâ€™s choice award for breakthrough of the year. now, youâ€™ve got 1 week to tell us which of three contenders will take home the honor: will it be ancient soil dna, in vivo crispr, or protein structure prediction by artificial intelligence?please cast your vote, via twitter poll, by monday, 13 december at 9 a.m. est. the winner will be announced on the science website at 2 p.m. est on thursday, 16 december, the same day science will reveal its own pick for breakthrough of the year.donâ€™t wait until itâ€™s too late! scroll through the finalists below, and happy voting!for years, scientists have known that ancient sediments harbor dna samples from our earliest human relatives. but this year, multiple teams made strides in findingâ€and untanglingâ€those threads, rewriting the history of humans and animals living in caves from spain to siberia.this year brought signs of success at using the crispr editing tool to modify genes inside the human body. an injection of genetic code for crispr reduced production of a toxic liver protein in several patients and modestly improved vision in two people with inherited blindness.for 50 years, scientists have struggled to solve one of natureâ€™s biggest challenges: predicting the 3d shape a string of amino acids will fold into as it becomes a working protein. artificial intelligence delivered big results this year, predicting the structures of thousands of proteins and complexes.choose your favorite for science's 2021 people's choice award for breakthrough of the year. â¬‡
