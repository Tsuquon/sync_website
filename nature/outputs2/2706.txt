an unlikely automobile is bringing new meaning to the phrase go fish. scientists put a fish tank on wheels to test whether goldfish (carassius auratus) can navigate as well on land as they can in water. the goldfish go-cart uses the laser sensing technology lidar, an onboard camera, and motion detection software to track the fish’s location in the tank. when it swims toward a wall with its nose pointed outward, the vehicle rolls in the same direction.to test their tank-steering skills, scientists put six goldfish—one at a time—into the car in the middle of a rectangular enclosure. whenever a fish piloted its vessel toward a pink board on one of the walls (above), it was given a food reward. after several days, the fish hit their target at least 15 times per 30-minute session. soon, each fish was able to locate the pink board even when its position was changed or when there were decoy boards of different colors, the researchers reported last month in behavioural brain research.the experiment shows goldfish navigation skills aren’t limited to their home environment, and the fish are capable of mastering a new skill in an unfamiliar setting, the researchers say. future studies could turn the tables, they suggest, putting terrestrial animals such as rats in makeshift submarines to see whether they do as well as fish out of water. they might also take the fish mobile into the great outdoors, testing fish driving skills in a more natural—and complex—environment.
