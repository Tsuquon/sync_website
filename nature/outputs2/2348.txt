most salamanders live in streams and under rocks or logs, but the wandering salamander (aneides vagrans) has a high-flying lifestyle. these 13-centimeter-long amphibians spend much or all of their lives in coastal redwoods, some of the tallest trees in the world. now, a laboratory study shows how they can descend by jumping, slowing their fall by spreading their limbs like a skydiver. to study the aerial ability of the wandering salamander, researchers brought several individuals into the lab along with three other species that vary in how well they climb. they put them into a wind tunnel with a fan blowing upward to simulate the animal falling.both the wandering salamander and its relative, the arboreal salamander (a. lugubris), often spread their limbs like a skydiver in freefall, maximizing drag. this slowed their descent by as much as 10%, the researchers report today in current biology. other times, the salamanders glided and turned in various directions by wiggling their legs and tail. in contrast, the speckled black salamander (a. flavipunctatus), which isn’t known for its climbing ability, and the ground-dwelling monterey ensatina (ensatina eschscholtzii), at best sometimes managed to glide but without much control.skydiving could be an effective way to avoid predators. it might also be a more efficient way of moving down the tree. the researchers are now studying the flight behavior with computer models to figure out how wandering salamanders—which have no obvious adaptions for flight, such as flaps of skin—generate lift to help them glide.
