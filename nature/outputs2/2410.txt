for the male orb-weaver spider, love bites. if they don’t escape immediately after mating, they are promptly consumed by their female partner. but a new study reveals a trick the males deploy to avoid this fate: they catapult away from their cannibalistic mates in a never-before-described feat of arachnid gymnastics.to get a better look at how the males make this impressive escape, researchers recorded orb-weavers (philoponella prominens) mating in the lab with high-resolution video, where they closely captured the precious postcoital moments (see video, above). from the videos, they calculated that the males’ catapulting speed was on average 65 centimeters per second—and that they rotate nearly 173 times per second as they escape through the air, the team reports today in current biology.next, the scientists examined the male orb-weavers under a microscope. they found that when a male pushes off its female partner, hydraulic pressure in front leg joints allows them to expand at lightning speed, launching the spider backward. each appendage also has sheathlike tissues wrapping around each joint, making them more elastic, and better able to extend and contract.the researchers say they think female cannibalism and male catapulting evolved antagonistically alongside one another. next, they hope to study female mating choices—and whether females pick mates who are most adept at acrobatically avoiding their postcoital advances.
