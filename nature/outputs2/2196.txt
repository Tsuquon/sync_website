white scientists are more likely to win a grant from the national science foundation than researchers from other racial and ethnic groups, according to an independent analysis of more than 2 decades of nsf data on its merit review process.the analysis supports earlier studies finding similar racial disparities in the funding of scientists by other federal agencies, notably the national institutes of health (nih). and its authors—a team led by geochemist christine yifeng chen, a postdoc at lawrence livermore national laboratory—attribute the gap in nsf funding rates, with white scientists at the top and asian researchers at the bottom, to systemic racism.the nsf funding disparities have cascading impacts that perpetuate a cumulative advantage to white [principal investigators] across all of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, they write in their study, posted earlier this month on the center for open science preprint site.the team gave a copy of its analysis to nsf leadership, which is not challenging its conclusions. nsf director sethuraman panchanathan shares these concerns [about] systemic racial disparities in funding at nsf and other federal agencies, an agency spokesperson says.the researchers delved into detailed annual nsf reports that contain data on 1 million proposals submitted to the agency between 1996 and 2019. the reports mention racial disparities only in passing, but chen and her team focused on them after hearing complaints from senior nonwhite colleagues about what they felt was an uneven playing field in winning nsf grants (see sidebar, below).i think it’s significant that this project was initiated by early-career scientists, chen says. it speaks to the prevailing culture in academia that allows the status quo to be perpetuated. we felt that if we didn’t do the analysis, nobody else would.every scientist submitting a proposal to nsf faces stiff competition; overall success rates fluctuated between 22% and 34% over the study period. but white scientists consistently did better, chen and colleagues found. (scientists are asked to voluntarily provide their race and ethnicity when applying for a grant.)for over 20 years:âž¡ï¸�proposals by white pis have been funded above overall ratesâž¡ï¸�proposals by most bipoc pis have been funded below overall ratesâž¡ï¸�and the relative funding rate for proposals by white pis has been *increasing*ðÿˆthese trends are also found in all directorates. pic.twitter.com/un1wt1qqjmin 2019, for example, nsf funded 31.3% of proposals from white scientists, versus an overall rate of 27.4%. in contrast, the success rate was 22.4% for asian scientists and 26.5% for black scientists. proposals from latino scientists were funded 29% of the time, a rate slightly above average but below the rate for white scientists.chen and colleagues translate the higher success rates into what they call surplus awards. in 2019, when nsf received about 42,000 proposals, the team calculated that white scientists received 798 surplus grants. the cumulative surplus over 20 years was 12,820 awards.in contrast, asian scientists received 460 fewer awards in 2019 than they would have had their success rate been comparable, with a cumulative unfunded total of 9701 awards. (asian scientists submit the second most proposals of the various groups every year, roughly half the number sent in by white scientists.) the relative advantage for white scientists has steadily grown, the analysis shows, from 3 percentage points above the agency’s average success rate in 1999 to 14 percentage points above in 2019.for black scientists, the funding gap over that period was smaller, but still significant. (black researchers submit one proposal for every 20 proposals nsf receives from white scientists.) the average funding rate for black scientists was 8 percentage points below that of white scientists, according to the preprint’s authors. pacific islander and native hawaiian scientists, an even smaller cohort of applicants, had success rates 11 percentage points below that of white scientists. in contrast, latino scientists—who submit about 50% more proposals to nsf than do black scientists—have done slightly better than the norm but were 2 percentage points below the success rate for white scientists in 2019.a study of racial disparities in national science foundation funding concludes that white researchers reaped a large cumulative surplus of awards between 1999 and 2019, whereas asian applicants experienced significant underfunding, with other groups falling in between.about 75% of the proposals nsf receives each year are classified as research proposals. the remaining requests are to support education and training, equipment and facilities, conferences, and other activities. white scientists enjoy an even larger advantage over most other groups in winning research awards, the study found. for nonresearch awards, most nonwhite groups did better than the nsf-wide average.in 2011, a team led by university of kansas, lawrence, economist donna ginther found similar racial disparities among nih grant recipients, including a gap of up to 13 percentage points in success rates between white and black scientists. that gap shrunk—but did not disappear—in follow-up studies that accounted for such factors as an applicant’s publication history, prior funding, age, academic rank, and how much research takes place at their institution.even so, former nih director francis collins last year apologized to individuals in the biomedical research enterprise who have endured disadvantages due to structural racism. nih has tried to reduce disparities with programs designed to increase the success of black applicants.unlike nih with ginther, nsf did not give chen’s team access to applicant data that would have allowed it to do such a multivariate analysis. that information would have been extremely valuable for looking at issues of intersectionality, says co-author aradhna tripati, a geoscientist at the university of california, los angeles. we also could have looked at the impact of nsf’s existing programs to foster equity and broader participation in science.even without that extra level of analysis, the study’s findings appear sound, says susan white, director of the statistical research center at the american institute of physics. it may not be exactly the number [the authors] present, but i don’t doubt that the disparity is real, and serious, she says.an nsf spokesperson says although the agency is proud of its array of programs designed to address equity and inclusion, there is still much [work] to do.a casual remark at one of the first meetings of a group formed in 2020 to provide a forum for asian american and pacific islanders in the geosciences led to the new analysis (see main story, above) documenting racial disparities in who receives grants from the national science foundation (nsf).you know that asian americans have a harder time getting nsf funding, a senior scientist told christine yifeng chen, a postdoc at lawrence livermore national laboratory who co-founded the affinity group. chen was taken aback by the comment and wondered whether there was any evidence to back up the claim. in fact, the conventional wisdom was that things were getting tougher for white scientists, chen says.the senior scientist referred her to an nsf webpage with data on all aspects of the agency’s vaunted merit review system. and after chen and sara kahanamoku, a graduate student at the university of california (uc), berkeley, checked out 25 years of annual reports, they learned that funding success rates for asians and other minoritized groups were indeed significantly lower than for white scientists. what’s more, the gap had been steadily growing over the past 2 decades.that discovery angered chen, a vocal advocate for greater equity, diversity, and inclusion in science, and spurred her and kahanamoku to take a closer look. but they feared that colleagues might ignore a paper by two early-career scientists who had never received an nsf grant nor even served as a proposal reviewer for the agency. so, they sought to enlist academics with such credentials in their research project.vernon morris was one who answered their call. an atmospheric chemist and senior administrator at arizona state university, morris had founded the first graduate program in atmospheric sciences at a historically black college or university when he was on the faculty at howard university. he's also a member of nsf’s committee on equal opportunities in science and engineering (ceose), the agency’s key advisory body on the topic.morris says the racial disparities in winning nsf grants wasn’t news to ceose, but the committee had never done the analysis at the same level of granularity. those details can be powerful tools in getting people to act, says geoscientist aradhna tripati of uc los angeles, another established academic who signed onto the project.but simply analyzing the publicly available data isn’t enough to build momentum for the actions needed to close the gap, morris cautions. nsf has data we don’t have that would provide an opportunity to dig deeper, he says. there’s also the structural problem, in terms of the community of volunteer reviewers [of nsf grant proposals, who] are predominantly white.he and the other co-authors hope nsf will tackle both issues. the next step is to propose and implement solutions, morris says. and we’re not there yet.
