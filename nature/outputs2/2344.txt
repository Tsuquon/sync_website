shrimp are flexible, in more ways than one. for many species in the palaemonidae family, that extends to their living quarters: they live inside other organisms, from sea urchins to oysters. now, a new study suggests many of these shrimp have switched from host to host—and sometimes back to their original host—multiple times over the millennia. what’s more, many of the hosts are only distantly related.in order to trace these switches, researchers used a sophisticated combination of genetic and observational data. they found that the ancestors of one group of palaemonid shrimp had all once lived inside ascidians, a group of tubular filter-feeding organisms that includes tunicates and sea squirts. some of their descendants have retained their ascidian associations. but at least six times during the group’s evolution, an enterprising species switched up its host, moving into the comfy confines of clams, snails, and cockles. a few of the descendants of those shrimp later returned to living inside ascidians.the researchers think these seemingly radical alterations in lifestyle were made possible by similar structures in ascidians and bivalve mollusks, they report this month in contributions to zoology. ascidian-dwelling shrimp live inside the pharyngeal basket, a structure used to filter food from the water. there, they eat mucus and food particles. that structure is similar to the mantle cavity of a mollusk—a hollow area of the body used in feeding, excretion, and respiration. indeed, shrimp that live inside mollusks make similar use of their hosts, harvesting mucus and fecal matter. the researchers suggest that examining the structures used by other endosymbiotic shrimp may reveal similar switches.
