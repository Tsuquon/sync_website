astronomers say they have witnessed a planet being born from a disk of gas and dust swirling around a young star. such claims have been made before, but the team comes to an even more controversial conclusion: that this planet is forming from gas that is collapsing under its own gravity, a mechanism known as gravitational or disk instability. that stands in contrast to a more widely accepted theory of planet formation, in which dust and rocks stick together, slowly building up a planetary core with enough gravity to pull in gas from the disk. if true, the planetary system would be the strongest evidence to date for disk instability. â€œthis system stands alone right now,â€� says team leader thayne currie of the subaru telescope in hawaii.that conclusion is already dividing theorists. â€œthis system certainly looks like itâ€™s [undergoing] disk instability,â€� says alan boss of the carnegie institution for science, a longtime advocate of the theory. but anders johansen, a theorist at the university of copenhagen who helped develop the rival theory of core accretion, is not convinced. â€œthis could be either mechanism,â€� he says.although more than 5000 exoplanets have been discovered, only a few tens have been imaged directly, and none in the act of being born. currie and colleagues were intrigued by the nearby star ab aurigae because it was youngâ€somewhere between 1 million and 4 million years oldâ€and because its disk contains kinked, spiral features that could indicate protoplanets. but showing that some of the light from its disk was from a glowing-hot new planet rather than reflected starlight was no easy task. â€œwe sat on this result for 5 years,â€� currie says. â€œi did not believe it was a planet until fairly recently.â€� using the subaru telescope and the hubble space telescope, the team zoomed in on a bright blob in one of the spiral arms of ab aurigaeâ€™s disk. it could simply be a denser part of the disk that scatters more starlight, but currie says the nature of the light indicates itâ€™s illuminated from within by a protoplanet still glowing hot from formation, the team reports today in nature astronomy. the blobâ€™s large sizeâ€bigger than the distance between the sun and earth (1 astronomical unit, or au)â€shows itâ€™s still shrouded in gas, inflating its apparent size. the proposed planet, dubbed ab aurigae b, is estimated to be nine times jupiterâ€™s mass and very distant from its star, three times farther than neptune is from the sun. â€œthe nice variety of data sets support the reality of the source, which might in fact be a forming giant planet embedded in the ab aurigae disk,â€� says aki roberge of nasaâ€™s goddard space flight center, who was not involved in the study.others are not entirely convinced there is a planet in there. â€œdirect imaging is a very subtle game,â€� says roman rafikov of the university of cambridge, and the elaborate data processing required can make images deceptive. he adds itâ€™s concerning that two other giant optical telescopes, europeâ€™s very large telescope in chile and the large binocular telescope observatory in arizona, see nothing at the location. heâ€™s also surprised that when the disk is viewed at other wavelengths, thereâ€™s little evidence for a planet. the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array, a radio observatory in chile, has only seen a smooth ring of dust outside the orbit of ab aurigae b, with no sign of the gravitational distortions that would be expected from such a large planet. â€œitâ€™s puzzling,â€� he says.just as controversial will be the teamâ€™s proposed formation mechanism. the classic theory of planet formation starts with dust grains sticking together, gradually building up to become â€œplanetesimals,â€� which are kilometers across in size. those planetesimals grow by colliding with others until they become protoplanets, hundreds or thousands of kilometers across. at that size, they can pull in more dust and gas with their own gravity. if a protoplanet gets to several earth masses, it can grab a thick envelope of gas and become a gas giant like jupiter or saturn.at long distances from a star, however, simulations suggest planetesimal collisions are rare, so it would take too long to build up a planetary core; winds from the newborn star would blow away the disk gas before the core could scoop it up. to explain how planets like jupiter can get around this, theorists including johansen and others came up with pebble accretion. the idea suggests planetesimals in the outer disk could grow faster, not through collisions, but by grabbing pebble-size material that has been made sluggish and easier to catch by thick gases. that growth is aided by the fact that this gas drag causes more pebbles to drift inward from the outer disk to where planets are forming.although most theorists believe this could make a solar system like ours, few would suggest it could lead to the quick formation of a giant planet as far from its star as ab aurigae b. â€œi donâ€™t understand how you can have pebble accretion form a nine-jupiter-mass planet at 93 au, and it be shining after 2 million years,â€� currie says.the alternative, disk instability, would only really work in the outer reaches of a disk rich in cool gas, where the starâ€™s gravity is weak and the gasâ€™ own gravity can get to work collapsing on itself. most researchers think such circumstances are so rare that disk instability is unlikely to play a major role in planet formation, but it has its adherents. boss says the fact that ab aurigae b appears as a large blob upholds disk instability, because any planet would form by condensing from a much larger cloud of gas.others will need more convincing. johansen says ab aurigae bâ€™s position in one of the diskâ€™s spiral arms could indicate either creation mechanism. the arms could be a sign of a cloud collapsing under its own gravity, or they could indicate a massive protoplanet drawing the cloud in. â€œitâ€™s ambiguous, a complete chicken and egg situation,â€� he says. â€œthis could be either. the reported evidence is not the final word, but iâ€™m still excited.â€�
