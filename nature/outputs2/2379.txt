when it comes to naming species theyâ€™ve discovered, scientists often like to have a little fun. thereâ€™s ba humbugi, a fiji snail referencing one of literatureâ€™s crankiest men. or spongiforma squarepantsii, a mushroom named after everyoneâ€™s favorite cartoon sponge. and for decades, researchers have named species after their colleagues or iconic researchers as a way to honor them, which is why some 300 species of animals are named after charles darwin.but that tradition may perpetuate societal biases, according to a new study of parasite names. the scientific names of nearly 3000 recently identified bloodsuckers, hijackers, and other banes of the biological world mostly honor men.perplexed by some of the stranger parasite monikers that occasionally grace the headlines, robert poulin, a parasitologist at the university of otago, dunedin, and his colleagues combed through studies published in eight prominent parasitology journals between 2000 and 2020. although discoveries of new species of mammals or birds are relatively rare, parasites represent the frontier of taxonomic research, with prodigious amounts of new species described each year. the year 2007 alone saw nearly 200 new parasites worm their way into the scientific record.for each new species description, the team recorded the species name, what it infects, and the reasoning behind its scientific name.of the 596 parasite species honoring an eminent scientist, only 18% immortalized women researchers, the team reports today in the proceedings of the royal society b. the gender gap has remained consistent for the past 20 years. and 89% of researchers lucky enough to have two or more parasites named after them were men.the result fits the few previous studies to tackle this question. for example, a 2010 paper examining the names of nearly 900 varieties of desert succulent plants in the genus aloe recorded an even starker disparity: species named after men scientists outnumbered those named after women scientists by more than 10 to one.those findings donâ€™t surprise rachel welicky, a parasitologist at neumann university who was not involved with the work. despite an influx of women parasitologists in recent years, welicky thinks parasitologyâ€™s long history of male-dominated research still affects naming conventions. â€œthe reality is that these are patterns that get gleaned after many decades.â€�janine caira, a parasitologist at the university of connecticut, storrs, also not involved with the new research, agrees. caira recently sifted through the 141 parasite species that she and her colleagues have named after peopleâ€and discovered that 63% were named after men.like welicky, caira thinks parasitologyâ€™s past drives much of the bias. â€œhistorically there has been a dearth of eminent female parasitologists who have worked on these groups of parasites.â€�in addition to the gender gap, the team also found that the average number of parasites named after a researcherâ€™s close friend or family member has steadily risen over the past 20 years. by 2020, roughly 30% of all species not named after their host, locality, or morphology were named after a researcherâ€™s relative or friend, up from about just 20% at the start of the study period. even researcherâ€™s pets are getting in on the honors. in 2011, a stingray tapeworm, rhinebothrium corbatai, was named after the lead authorâ€™s welsh terrier, corbata.the team argues such names can come at the expense of honoring often overlooked collectors, technicians, and local scientists who are essential to research. for example, the study mentions the case of tatiana pequeã±o saco, a local conservationist at peruâ€™s cordillera azul national park who helped a group of parasitologists collect fish specimens from a dense region of the amazon. to thank her, researchers named uvulifer pequenae, a flatworm that frequents the guts of kingfishers, after her.caira, who herself is the namesake of a suite of tapeworms, is a proponent of this naming philosophy. â€œiâ€™m a big fan of naming a tapeworm after whoever helped us collect it,â€� she says. many of the new species she has described from her fieldwork on tapeworms that infect sharks and stingrays in southeast asia bear the names of boat captains and fishermen who helped reel in specimens.poulin and his co-authors hope their study nudges parasitologists to put more care into coining monikers that reflect the diversity of the scientific community. â€œthey may not follow our naming suggestions, but they cannot deny the data.â€�
