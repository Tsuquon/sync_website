strap on a snorkel, and it’s not hard to find yourself at an underwater orchestra. but along with shouting fish and snapping shrimp, there appears to be a new addition to the nautical ensemble: the stingray.a newly released video compilation documents three individuals from two species of stingray—the mangrove whipray (urogymnus granulatus) and the cowtail stingray (pastinachus ater)—making short clicks when approached by swimmers. the noises coincide with the movement of the rays’ spiracles, slits behind their eyes they use to breathe while resting on the ocean floor. researchers published the recordings, taken between october 2017 and december 2018 in the gili islands of indonesia and the great barrier reef in australia, this month in ecology, marking the first evidence of stingrays voluntarily producing sounds in the wild.the scientists suspect these noises may serve to ward off predators or call to other rays for backup. although the frequencies span the expected hearing range of these stingrays and their known predators, no thorough hearing tests have been performed on any of those species, the authors note. further research is needed to confirm both the mechanism and function of the clicks.still, the fact that it took so long to discover the stingray’s song leaves ecologists wondering: what other musicians go unnoticed in the symphony of the sea?
